People bought almost three million stamps / from Stamps.com.
But a problem developed.
The company had to reject / some of the pictures / because of ownership questions.
Some people tried to play tricks.
They sent orders for stamps / showing the pictures of well-known criminals.  / As a result, sales were suspended.
Recently, Postal Service officials approved / another testing period / for Photo Stamps.
This time, the company has restricted / what kinds of pictures it will accept.
For example, it will not accept pictures / that are objectionable or insulting.
Also, it will not accept pictures / of famous people.
These include actors, / politicians, world leaders or convicted criminals.
Company workers are now trained / to recognize such pictures / from history and news events.
They are also looking for any pictures / protected by copyright, / such as works of art.
So, now, anyone in the United States can get a picture / of their baby, wedding, family holiday or pet / on a real postage stamp / and use it / to mail a letter.
The stamps include a postal service mark / and one / that protects it / against criminals / who would try to make illegal copies.
Stamps ordered from Stamps.com cost / more than two times the amount / of those bought from the post office.
But Postal Service officials believe / that Photo Stamps may get more Americans / to send letters through the mail / instead of using Internet e-mail.
Valentine's Day is a special time / for love.
Millions of people will receive / flowers, chocolate or some other gift.
Tradition tells us / that Saint Valentine was a third-century Roman / who performed marriages / and died / for his Christian beliefs / on February 14.
That was a day celebrated / in ancient Rome / in connection with love.
There are many ways / for people to meet.
Some meet at work.
Others meet by chance.
Still others look for help / from services / that bring people together.
Friends and family members might offer / to help.
They might plan / a blind date.
This is a meeting / between two people / who have never seen each other before.
And, unless things go well, / may never see each other again.
In movies, two people often fall in love / after what Hollywood calls a "cute meet." / They might be lawyers / on opposite sides / in a court case.
Or one person gets a letter / meant for the other.
Or their dogs get into a fight / on the street.
Who knows / how many people really do meet / this way.
In real life, / finding a person and establishing a relationship is usually hard work.
A lot of people try to improve their chances / by looking in places / where people with similar interests go.
Singles may join health clubs or sports teams / where men and women play together.
If nothing else, / at least they get some exercise.
But sometimes / none of these efforts succeed.
So people might try to meet someone / over the Internet.
Internet dating services had been growing sharply / through the end of 2003.
But the industry growth rate has slowed.
What we are about to say / may come as no shock, / but people do not always tell the truth / about themselves online.
And if they do not exactly lie about their age, for example, / then they might offer an old picture instead.
However two people meet, / once they have made a date, / either alone or with friends, / the question becomes where to go.
They might go out to eat.
They might go / for a long walk.
Or they might go dancing, / or to a movie or a museum or a concert.
However they spend their time, / the important thing|Valentine's Day or not| is that / they are spending it together.
"Star Wars: Episode ‡V|Revenge of the Sith" opened last week / around the world.
In the United States, / it earned more money / in its first 24 hours / than any other movie in history.
It sold 50 million dollars worth of tickets / in one day.
The film also earned more money / in the United States / in its first four days / than any other movie / -more than 158 million dollars.
It also earned / more than 144 million dollars / in other countries.
Faith Lapidus has more.
"Revenge of the Sith" is the last in the series / of six "Star Wars" movies.
American film director George Lucas produced / the first "Star Wars" movie in 1977.
The first three movies in the series told the story / of wars among planets / that took place a long time ago / in a galaxy far, far away.
Those three movies were / "Star Wars", "The Empire Strikes Back" and "The Return of the Jedi".
The main characters were / Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi and the evil Darth Vader.
But George Lucas wanted to tell more stories / about what happened / in the years / before the first "Star Wars" movies take place.
He wanted to explain more / about Darth Vader and his connections / to the other characters.
Lucas waited for years / to make those movies / until motion picture technology developed / the special effects he wanted.
"Star Wars: Episode ‡T | The Phantom Menace" opened / in 1999.
It is about Anakin Skywalker, / the boy / who would grow up / to become Darth Vader.
Three years later, / "Attack of the Clones" continued the story / of Anakin Skywalker.
It ended / with his marriage to Padme Amidala.
The new movie, "Revenge of the Sith," tells / how Anakin Skywalker turns away / from the good Jedi knights / and becomes their enemy, Darth Vader.
It explains / why his children, Luke and Leia, were separated / at birth.
Critics generally said / "Revenge of the Sith" is one of the best / of the six movies.
Some said it is the best one.
They especially praised / the action in the film and the special effects.
However, they said / it is more violent / than the other "Star Wars" films / and is not for young children.
So what will George Lucas do / now that the "Star Wars" series is finished?
He told Time Magazine recently / that he is planning to produce a film / about African-American fighter pilots / in World War‡U.
And he wants to make another movie / about the action hero he created, / Indiana Jones.
This week, we tell about / one of the most successful American businesswomen.
Mary Kathlyn Wagner was born / in the state of Texas in 1918.
For much of her childhood, / she cared for her sick father / while her mother worked long hours / at a public eating place.
Mary Kay married Ben Rogers / when she was seventeen years old.
They had three children / before he left home / to serve in World War ‡U.
When he returned, their marriage ended.
Mary Kay looked for a job / so she could support her children.
Mary Kay began selling / different kinds of products.
At first, she sold books.
Later, she visited peoplesf homes / to show / how home care products / such as cleaning fluids and equipment / helped ease housework.
One night, Mary Kay was showing these products / at the home of Ova Heath Spoonemore.
Later in the evening, / Mrs. Spoonemore began giving her guests / some home made skin care products.
The products were developed / by her father, J.W. Heath, in Arkansas.
Mary Kay tried the skin care products and found / they made her skin smooth.
Mary Kay was successful / selling home care products.
Her supervisors praised her work.
But they never increased her earnings.
She left the company / after a man she trained was given a more important job / than she had.
It taught her / that men did not believe / that a woman could succeed in business.
She decided / to prove them wrong.
So she bought the rights / to Mr. Heathfs skin care products / and started her own company.
The Mary Kay Cosmetics company began operating / in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.
The idea was to sell skin care products / through demonstrations / in homes and offices.
Nine sales representatives were chosen / to sell the products.
The sales representatives were independent workers.
They bought products / like soaps and skin softening liquids / from the company / and sold them at higher prices / to friends, family members and other individuals.
Mary Kay decided / that each representative / who brought other sales women into the company / would receive / part of the new personfs earnings.
That way, / experienced sales representatives would be willing / to help train new ones.
Mary Kay told the women / who worked for her / that to be successful in life / a person should put God first, / family second and work third.
She said women must discover / how to be good wives and mothers / while at the same time / learning how to succeed in work.
Now Mary Kay Cosmetics is the largest direct seller / of skin care products / in the United States.
Today Shirley Griffith and Rich Kleinfeldt tell about a man / who changed professional baseball / in the United States.
Jackie Roosevelt Robinson was the first black man to play / in modern major league baseball.
No black man had played / for a major league baseball team / since 1884.
In that year, / American baseball organizations agreed / to bar blacks.
That began changing / when Jackie Robinson played his first game / for New York's Brooklyn Dodgers / on April 15, 1947.
Jackie Robinson established himself early / as an athlete.
He was a star player / while attending the University of California.
Jackie Robinson left college early / because of financial problems.
He joined the United States Army in 1941, / during the second World War.
However, after three years, Robinson was dismissed / from the army / because he objected to a racial order.
He refused to move / to the back of a bus.
In 1945, there were not many jobs open / to a black man, / even someone / who had attended college.
Robinson wanted to play professional baseball.
Blacks, however, were not permitted to play / in the major leagues.
So, he decided to play / with the Negro Baseball League.
The Negro League teams were started / in the 1920s / to give black people a place / to play baseball.
Jackie Robinson played / for the Kansas City Monarchs.
It was one of the most famous baseball teams / in the Negro League.
But, he was unhappy in the Negro League / because of the difficult life there.
In 1945, Jackie Robinson signed an agreement / with Branch Rickey / to play for the Dodgers.
Rickey was president of the team.
He wanted to find a black player / who could deal / with the insults and racial pressure / he would face / in the league.
He wanted a black player / who would show restraint / at all times.
Rickey thought / Jackie Robinson was good enough / as a player / and strong enough as a person / to succeed.
He made Robinson promise / that he would never show his anger / on the baseball field.
Jackie Robinson accepted that condition.
He said: / "I knew / that I was going to be somewhat out front / and perhaps, I would have to take a lot of abuse.
I knew / that this was bigger / than any one individual / and I would have to do / whatever I possibly could / to control myself." / In 1946, Jackie Robinson began playing / for the Dodgers' minor league Canadian team, the Montreal Royals.
During that time, / Branch Rickey tested Robinson's ability / to deal with racial pressure / he would face in the major league.
In 1947, Jackie Robinson became the first black / to play modern major league baseball.
He played / for the Dodger's major league team, New York's Brooklyn Dodgers.
In doing so, / the pressure increased.
During games, pitchers threw the ball / at his head.
Several teams threatened / not to play against the Dodgers.
Jackie Robinson had difficulty / on and off the baseball field, / but he did not let that interfere / with his game.
He was a great player and leader, / winning the National League's Most Valuable Player award in 1949.
He also led the Brooklyn Dodgers / to six league championships / and to baseball's World Series Championship in 1955.
Millions of people in the United States are enjoying / the return of spring.
During this season, many Americans do / what is known as "spring cleaning." / They open the windows / of their homes / to let in fresh air.
They use cleaning products / that make their homes smell nice.
And, they organize their belongings.
Some Americans have developed a strong interest / in cleaning up their homes.
This also can be called / removing clutter.
Clutter is a disorganized collection of things.
To remove clutter means / to throw away the things / you do not want.
Then, organize the things / you have decided to keep.
In recent years, it has become easy / to find information / on how to attack clutter.
There are books, magazines / and even television programs / on the subject.
Some Americans pay people / to come to their home / to remove clutter.
Such people provide advice / on what to keep and what to throw away.
Some people have serious problems / with clutter.
They suffer a mental disorder / called compulsive hoarding syndrome.
Hoarding is the gathering of objects / and not being able to throw them away.
Most people would say / the objects are useless or worthless.
However, the hoarder considers them things / that could be useful some day.
He or she may develop an emotional connection / to such things.
Hoarders are afraid / to throw away things.
Yet, they continue to bring / more and more objects / into their homes.
They may save things / such as newspapers, / clothing, old food and even animals.
Safety experts say / the homes of hoarders often are unsafe.
A room / filled with newspapers, for example, / can cause floor supports to break down.
In many cases, / a room is filled / from top to bottom / with useless things.
There is only a small space to walk / from one end of the room to the other.
Compulsive hoarding syndrome can be treated.
However, it is very difficult.
The treatment may involve medicines / and working with a mental health expert.
The expert helps hoarders / to understand their actions / of saving useless things.
Patients are taught / to develop a plan / for organizing.
They learn how to decide / what to throw away.
They learn to resist the urge / to bring home more things.
Agricultural scientists are continually looking for new ways / to improve crops, control insects / and reduce the need for chemicals.
It is a never-ending search.
It often results / in finding a solution / for one problem / while making another problem worse.
Sometimes, however, farmers can solve several problems / at the same time.
They can do this / by carefully choosing the crops they plant / in the same field.
In the early 1990's / the magazine Organic Gardening, from the Rodale Institute, / published some studies / on this subject.
There was advice / from a scientist named Kimberly Stoner, / an insect expert / at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.
She said farmers can keep flea beetles / out of broccoli fields / by planting clover / in the same field.
Flea beetles cannot find broccoli / when it is surrounded / by clover.
So the insect flies away / in search of broccoli / that is growing in a field / without clover.
Another method of protecting the main crop / is to plant it / in the same field / with some plants / that insects do not like.
For example, the Colorado potato beetle does not like tansy / because of the strong smell / of this herb.
So researchers / at the Rodale Institute / planted tansy / in several potato fields.
The population of Colorado potato beetles was reduced / anywhere from 60 to 100 percent.
The reduction depended / on the amount of tansy planted.
Studies done later / in a laboratory / showed / that tansy produces a natural chemical / that keeps the potato beetle at a distance.
In fact, some insects like weeds / more than they like crop plants.
Scientists did some research / at the Subtropical Cotton Insects Research Station / in Texas.
They planted ragweed and pigweed / in a field of bell peppers.
Leaf miner insects can destroy a bell pepper crop.
But, when given a choice of bell peppers or ragweed and pigweed, / the insects chose the weeds.
In another experiment, / researchers in India planted / cabbage and mustard greens / in the same field.
They were attempting to control / diamondback moths and leafwebbers.
In three separate tests, / the insects chose the mustard greens / instead of the main crop, the cabbage.
Several plays by Arthur Miller / will probably be performed / for many years to come.
That is because critics say / Miller was able to dramatize the emotional pain / that average people suffer / in their daily lives.
A critic once described Miller / as an activist / for the common man.
He demonstrates this well / in one of his most famous plays, "Death of a Salesman." / The main character is a man / whose dreams of success in business have died.
Arthur Miller was born in New York City / in 1915.
He died in 2005 / at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut.
For sixty years, he created / one dramatic work after another.
Miller won many awards / for his plays.
Among them were a Pulitzer Prize, / New York Drama Criticsf Circle prizes / and Tony awards.
Millerfs great play, "Death of a Salesman", opened / on Broadway in 1949.
He was 33 years old / when he wrote it.
"Death of a Salesman" questions the pressures / in American society / for people to gain financial success.
The play also continues his exploration / of the relationships / between fathers and sons.
The central character / in "Death of a Salesman" / is sixty-year-old Willy Loman.
The action opens / on the last day of Willyfs life.
He has been dismissed from his job / as a traveling salesman.
He also recognizes / that he has failed / as a father.
Willy thinks / about killing himself.
Willyfs wife Linda understands / that he is deeply and dangerously sad.
But their son Biff criticizes / his fatherfs strange actions.
She answers / with some of the most famous words / in the American theater: / "I donft say hefs a great man.
Willy Loman never made a lot of money.
His name was never in the papers.
But hefs a human being, / and a terrible thing is happening to him.
So attention must be paid.
Hefs not to be allowed to fall / into his grave / like an old dog.
Attention, attention must finally be paid / to such a person.
You called him crazyc" / "I didnft meanc" / LINDA: "No, a lot of people think  / hefs lost his - balance.  / But you donft have to be very smart to know / what his trouble is.
The man is exhausted." / Linda knows / that Willy is extremely tired.
He is tired of living.
He kills himself / before the play is over.
Linda talks to Willy / at his burial place: / "I search and search and I search, / and I canft understand it.
Willy, I made the last payment / on the house today.
Today, dear.
And therefll be nobody homec" / "Death of a Salesman" had a big influence / on the American public.
Many people saw their own lives / in Willy Loman, / the victim of broken dreams.
Americans discussed / the financial worries of businessmen / who were getting old.
But Americans were not the only ones / who identified / with the ideas in the play.
It has been translated / into about thirty languages / and performed around the world.
Identity theft has been a subject / in the news recently.
It is considered / one of the top crimes / in the United States.
The Federal Trade Commission estimates / that ten million Americans become victims / of identity theft each year.
Identity thieves steal personal information.
They collect Social Security numbers, / banking records and telephone numbers.
They use this information / to request loans / or get credit cards / in the name of the victim.
Identity thieves spend a lot / on goods or services / without paying for them.
FTC officials estimate / more than 52 thousand million dollars in goods and services were purchased / last year / through identity theft.
Victims of identity theft can spend years / attempting to re-establish / their financial history and good name.
Some have been denied jobs / or arrested for crimes / in which they were not involved.
Identity thieves use several methods / to get what they need.
They may trick people / into giving personal information / over the telephone.
They also may steal documents / containing such information.
Activist groups have called for new laws / to protect the public / from identity theft.
Recently, a committee of the United States Senate said / it would hold hearings on the issue.
Two cases of identity theft helped the committee / to call the hearings.
Last month, Bank of America said / it lost computer tapes / containing personal information / for more than one million federal employees.
They include some Senators / and members of the Defense Department.
Bank of America says / it deeply regrets the incident.
Earlier, the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported / that thieves stole about 150,000 personal records / from ChoicePoint Incorporated.
The company sells / Social Security numbers and credit information / to other businesses.
In 2002, / a similar security violation reportedly affected / about seven thousand people.
American lawmakers will consider plans / to increase supervision of companies / that collect personal information.
Several plans have been proposed / to help individuals / whose personal information was stolen.
Another proposal would let Americans halt / any investigation / into their financial history / without their permission.
Many people in the United States suffered / emotional or mental problems / after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
Terrorism creates fear / and fear often leads to severe stress.
Studies suggest / that stress can reduce the bodyfs ability / to fight disease / and can lead to serious health problems.
Stress affects everybody every day.
It is your bodyfs reaction / To physical, chemical, emotional or environmental influences.
Some stress is unavoidable / and may even be good for us.
Stress can keep our bodies and minds strong.
It gives us the push we need / to react to an urgent situation.
Some people say / it makes them more productive at work /  and gives them more energy.
Too much stress, however, can be harmful.
It may make an existing health problem worse.
Or it can lead to other illnesses or disease / if a person is at risk for the condition.
For example, your body reacts / to stressful situations / by raising your blood pressure / and making your heart work harder.
This is especially dangerous / if you already have heart disease / or high blood pressure.
Stress is more likely to be harmful / if you feel helpless / to deal with the problem or situation / that causes the stress.
Anything you see as a problem / can cause stress.
It can be caused / by everyday situations / or by major problems.
Stress results / when something causes your body to act / as if it were under attack.
Causes of stress can be physical, / such as injury or illness.
Or they can be mental, / such as problems with your family, / job, health or finances.
Many visits to doctors are for conditions / connected with stress.
The tension of stress can interfere with sleep / or cause uncontrollable anger or sadness.
A person may become more forgetful / or find it harder to think clearly.
Losing onefs sense of humor is another sign / of an unhealthy amount of stress.
Stress can lead to other health problems / if people try to ease it / by smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs, / or by eating more or less than normal.
Experts say / exercise is one of the most effective stress-reduction measures.
Running, walking or playing sports causes physical changes / that make you feel better.
Exercise also improves the bodyfs defenses / against disease.
And a recent study found / that it helps protect / against a decrease in mental ability.
Doctors say / deep, slow breathing also is helpful.
And many medical studies have shown / that clearing the mind / through quiet meditation / helps you become calm.
This causes lower blood pressure, / reduced muscle tension / and decreased heart rate.
Experts say / keeping stress to yourself can make problems worse.
Researchers have linked / the inability to identify and express emotions / to many health conditions.
These include eating disorders, / fear disorders and high blood pressure.
They say / expressing emotions to friends or family members / or writing down your feelings / can help reduce stress.
Experts say / people should try to accept or change / stressful situations / whenever possible.
Reducing stress may help you feel better / and live longer.
Too much sun can cause skin cancer.
Too much vitamin D can also make you sick.
Yet a study suggests / that sunlight and vitamin D may help / some people with lung cancer live longer.
Vitamin D helps build / strong teeth and bones.
Foods / such as oily fish and egg yolks / are high in vitamin D.
But not many foods naturally are.
So extra vitamin D is often added / to milk products.
Some people get more / with vitamin products.
Another way is with the sun.
Vitamin D is known / as the "sunshine vitamin." / The body produces it / through the skin / from the ultraviolet radiation / of the sun.
Researchers from Harvard University led a study / of 456 people.
These men and women had been treated / for lung cancer / in Boston, Massachusetts.
The cancers had been found early.
Doctors operated / to remove them.
The average age of the patients was 69.
40 percent were smokers.
Researchers asked the people / what they ate, / what vitamins they took / and what time of year their operations had taken place.
Some had high levels of vitamin D intake / and had their operations / during summertime, / when there is lots of sun.
Others had low levels, / and were operated on / in winter.
The researchers found / that 30 percent of the people / in this second group / were alive / 5 years after their operation.
46 percent were disease-free.
But patients / with the highest vitamin D intake and summer operations / had higher survival rates.
72 percent were still alive / after 5 years.
And 83 percent were disease-free.
The findings were presented / at a meeting / of the American Association for Cancer Research.
Other studies are needed / to confirm them.
Harvard researcher Wei Zhou says / studies on animals have shown / that vitamin D may be able to act / against some cancers.
He says the new study does not suggest / that people should try to time their cancer surgery / for a particular season.
But he says / increasing the use of vitamin D / before such treatment / could help.
Lung cancer is the most common cancer / around the world, / with more than one million new cases / each year.
And it kills more people / than any other cancer.
About 60 percent of those / who get lung cancer / die within a year.
The major preventable cause is the use / of tobacco.
Our question this week comes from a listener / in Argentina.
Raul Colquehuanca wants to know / how Americans are protected / from the food industry and unsafe food.
The Food and Drug Administration is the main government agency / responsible for food safety / in the United States.
It is involved in food inspection / from start to finish.
Investigators supervise the manufacture, / import, transport, storage and sale / of thousands of millions of dollars worth of food products.
The agency makes rules / for almost 95,000 businesses / in the United States.
The agency has about 9,000 employees.
Investigators are among them.
FDA investigators inspect / thousands of food manufacturers and farms / each year.
The investigators make sure / that food products are made correctly.
And they make sure / that the information labels on the products are truthful.
They often collect products / for label inspections or testing / by FDA scientists.
The FDA also supervises the food and drugs / that farmers give / to cows and other animals / that provide meat / that is sold to the public.
The Food and Drug Administration has several choices / if a business is found / violating any of the laws / the agency enforces.
FDA officials can urge the business / to correct the problem.
Or, they can legally remove, or recall, / bad food products / from the marketplace.
About three thousand products are recalled / in the United States each year.
In addition, / FDA inspectors will seize products / if they appear to be unfit / for public use.
About 30,000 shipments of imported goods are seized / at American ports every year.
The federal government has not always been responsible / for the quality of food and drugs / in the United States.
In the 19th century, / American states were generally responsible / for the safety of locally-made food and drugs.
In 1906, / President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Food and Drugs Act into law.
It banned the transport and sale / of unclean or falsely labeled foods, drinks and drugs.
In 1927, / the Food, Drug and Insecticide Administration was established.
Later, its name was changed / to the Food and Drug Administration.
Today, the FDA is part / of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Another question this week involves historical events / that have been in the news recently.
Abdullah El-Fakhri of Libya wants to know / about Watergate.
Faith Lapidus tells us more.
The Watergate scandal is the name / given to illegal activities / designed to help President Nixon win reelection / in 1972.
These included stealing, / violating campaign finance laws / and attempting to use government agencies / to harm political opponents.
They also included / trying to keep these actions secret.
About 40 people were charged / with crimes linked to Watergate.
Some were high-level government officials.
Most were found guilty in court / or admitted their guilt.
President Richard Nixon and his supporters were members / of the Republican Party.
These activities became known as Watergate / because the first illegal act took place / in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C.
Police arrested five men / for breaking into the national offices of the Democratic Party / on June 17th, 1972.
One of the men was the security chief / of the committee to reelect the President.
A spokesman for President Nixon denied / that anyone who worked for the president was involved.
But two reporters found evidence / that presidential assistants helped pay / for sabotage and spying / against candidates / for the 1972 Democratic Party presidential nomination.
Other evidence was discovered later.
It included a voice recording / that proved President Nixon ordered his assistants / to hide evidence of illegal activities / by his re-election committee.
Congress began steps / to remove the president from office / for hiding evidence / and using presidential power illegally.
President Nixon resigned / on August 9th, 1974.
Two young reporters from the Washington Post newspaper started the investigation  / that led to the president's resignation.
Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein became famous / for these reports about Watergate.
They wrote a book about their investigation / called "All The President's Men".
In the book, they told about a secret source / who provided them with important information.
They called him "Deep Throat." / And they promised / to keep his name a secret / until after he died.
Three weeks ago, / a man named Mark Felt told the world / that he was "Deep Throat." / In the early 1970s, / Mr. Felt was the assistant chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
He said that he secretly helped the reporters / because other high level government officials were trying to hide information / about Watergate, / not bring it out into the open.
