Finally tonight, it's prom season / and Steve Hartman met the queen and her king, / On the Road.
At Mountain Heritage High School in Burnsville, North Carolina, / Rachel Newberry caught Ben Robinson / completely off guard.
You didn't know / what was happening, did you?
Did you tell you were a little surprised, / you were a little shocked?
Yes, yes.
Ben, who has Down syndrome, had no idea / Rachel was going to ask him / to senior prom.
Every year we see stories like this - / a typical kid inviting / a special needs kid to prom.
Stories of kindness.
But what makes this so different / is that Rachel wasn't trying to be kind.
In fact, when she posted the video / and strangers started commenting / that she was this amazing, incredible young lady / with a very good heart, / Rachel was a little put off.
Yeah, it's not that at all.
I don't think that / me asking my friend to prom / makes me a good person.
To understand / how Rachel became so wonderfully oblivious / to her own grace, / you need to go back / to where this all started.
Rachel and Ben have known each other / their entire lives.
They were in Sunday school together / and immediately took to one another.
Rachel was always the one person / who could get Ben to calm down.
And Ben was always the one person / Rachel could count on.
Their friendship, so unconditional, / for the longest time Rachel didn't even know / Ben had Down syndrome.
I guess someone told me eventually / and explained it. But...
Did it change anything?
No, no, he's still just my best friend / after that.
When you say best friend, you mean best friend.
I mean it. Best friend, yeah.
This is what people didn't understand / when they saw your video.
Yeah.
Fifty years ago, / back when a lot of special needs kids / were still being institutionalized, / few people could have ever imagined / a utopian moment such as this - / a time and place / where differences melt away / and kids like Ben are recognized less / for their Down syndrome, / and more for their ability to get down.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Burnsville, North Carolina.
Fantastic! Just fantastic!
We end tonight with a father and son / with an extra special reason to celebrate this Sunday.
Here's Mark Strassmann.
What brought Malcolm Stewart and his father / to this fish market / wasn't the catch of the day, / but the catch of a lifetime.
This Sunday / they will spend their first Father's day together / in almost four decades.
When you were a kid, / what was Father's Day like?
I didn't have a father.
So, it was just a blank day.
In my mind I'm just thinking / that he just was gonna die in jail.
His father, Malcolm Alexander, / was convicted of rape in 1980.
The sentence was life / with no chance of parole.
But Louisiana inmate number 93124 was innocent.
DNA evidence finally proved it.
And in January he walked out to his family / and freedom.
He was now 58.
To actually hug him / as a free man, / is like a dream come true.
Words can't even explain / how I felt / for all the emotion I was feeling / at that time.
His father had spent almost 38 years / behind bars.
It's a hard life / to live without them.
'Cause you're living without love.
You see, there is no love / in the institution.
There is in this home / outside New Orleans.
Malcom Stewart was two / when his father went to prison.
You go to your friend's house / and they have their Dad / and it's like, 'Wow man, I wish I had Dad.' / This Father's Day, he will, / after a lifetime of prison visits and phone calls / to a Dad / who never deserved to spend one minute / behind bars.
What's it like just to be able to sit / side by side after 38 years?
No rush. No rush.
Nowhere, when, where to go?
We're here.
We've made it where we wanted to go.
You don't seem bitter at all.
There's no time to even think about / nothing negative, being mad.
None of that.
My Dad's here, it's Father's Day, I'm very happy, / you know what I mean?
It's like I said a new beginning.
This family has one word / in their Father's Day card: gratitude.
Mark Strassmann, CBS News, New Orleans. That is the CBS Evening News tonight. I'm Jeff Glor. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.
Many of you could be watching the NCAA tournament / just after this broadcast.
To get you warmed up, / here is Steve Hartman / with one of his favorite plays / on the courts.
At Coronado High School in El Paso, Texas, / coach Peter Morales made no qualms about it.
Back in 2013, / he had a favorite on this team.
Mitchell, I need you.
Help me out, Mitchell.
Then team manager, Mitchell Marcus, / has a developmental disability, / but he surpassed / everyone here / when it came to love of the game.
He's just an amazing person / that our basketball team loves being around.
Tonight, we have a great update / on this story, / but in case you missed the original, / it all began five years ago, / during the last game of the regular season, / when coach Morales told his manager / to suit up.
Just wearing a jersey was enough / for Mitchell, / but what he didn't know / was that the coach planned / to play him.
And so it was, / with a minute and a half left, / Coach Morales put in his manager.
And just started hearing, 'Mitchell, Mitchell.' / But here's where / the fairy tale fell apart.
Although his teammates did / everything they could / to get Mitchell a basket, / each time they passed him the ball / he either missed the shot, / or like on their last possession, / booted it out of bounds, / turning the ball over to the other team / with just seconds left.
He wasn't gonna be able to score, / but I was hoping that he was happy / that he was just put in the game.
Could you have ever imagined / what happened next?
No, I didn't¬Åc I could not. Not at all.
What happened next happened on the inbound.
The guy with the ball there was a senior / at Franklin High School.
Number 22, Jonathan Montanez.
I was raised to treat others / how you want to be treated.
Just thought Mitchell deserved his chance, / deserved his opportunity.
What Jonathan did / was yell out Mitchell's name, / then threw the ball right to him / - right there - / one of the most memorable turnovers / of all time.
After this story first aired, / Jonathan and Mitchell became friends.
They received many accolades.
The most significant went to Jonathan / and it came from the chancellor of Texas Tech University, / who saw our story and offered Jonathan / a scholarship / - almost certainly the only scholarship / ever awarded / for a turnover.
Jonathan will graduate this summer / with a degree in kinesiology, / and our award / for outstanding sportsmanship.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in El Paso, Texas.
We end the week / with a history lesson / taught by a fourth-grader.
Steve Hartman met her, On the Road.
So what were you here for?
Soccer game.
Ten-year-old Sarah Haycox says / she was just walking through this park / in Shoreline, Washington ...
So, just about a year ago?
Yeah.
... when she came across something curious: / It was like the beginning of a mystery.
Yeah.
A stone with a plaque.
This is what I first saw.
It was clearly a tribute, / but to whom?
Edwin T. Pratt, 1930 - 1969.
And I'm like, / 'Wow, that's really short life.' / And just did the quick math in my head / and was like, 'He died at thirty-nine?' / Did you wonder why?
Yeah. I'm just like, 'that's not typical.' / And since there were no other markings, / and no one around to ask, / Sarah took it upon herself / to learn all she could / about the life and death / of Edwin Pratt.
She learned he was director / of the Seattle Urban League, / worked on school desegregation / and was the first black person / to move into Sarah's town.
It was a bold and fatal decision.
Pratt was assassinated / right there on the front porch, / nine months after Martin Luther King Jr.
It was just the lack of recognition / that really, I think, maybe, stunned me.
Stunned you?
Yeah. And just felt like / he's gotta have something more / than just a plaque outside of a bathroom.
About that same time, / across the street from Sarah's school, / she noticed / the district was putting up a new earlylearning center.
She found out / it didn't have a name yet, / and her wheels started turning.
Sarah launched a petition drive / and went all over town, / explaining to anyone who would listen / why that new building should be named after Pratt.
Thank you for helping me honor Edwin Pratt.
She did a ton of stuff.
Curtis Campbell is with the school district.
It's difficult times, / but brighter futures are ahead of us / and it's because of kids like Sarah.
Indeed, a lot of people in Shoreline have been inspired / by Sarah / and many have boarded her bandwagon.
Would all of those here tonight to support Edwin Pratt / please raise your hands?
This was her eighth school board meeting / and by far her most important.
The board was about to vote / on her suggestion.
All in favor, say aye.
Aye.
All opposed, say nay.
The vote is unanimous.
The motion carries.
Thanks to Sarah, / there will never be another kid in Shoreline  / who doesn't know the name Edwin T. Pratt.  / And someday, if she keeps this up, / everyone will also know the name Sarah Haycox.  / Steve Hartman, On the Road in Shoreline, Washington  / Brighter times are ahead, / because of kids like Sarah.
How great is that?
That is the CBS Evening News tonight. I'm Jeff Glor. I'll see you again Monday. Have a great weekend. 
It is last call for us this week / and we raise a glass / to the amazing barkeeper Steve Hartman met  / On the Road.
Generally speaking, / bars are not bastions of grace and kindness.  / But here at Jimmy's in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina,  / owner Jimmy Gilleece believes / there's a lot more to serving customers / than a good pour.
I mean, just wait till you hear / what he did for one patron, / a total stranger, / who lost her wallet here last month / with her wedding ring inside.
And she was frantic, / really upset about it, / so it just became my mission.
His mission to find her ring began / with a thorough screening / of the security footage.
He had to watch three hours / before finally finding her wallet / on a bench outside the bar / - the one at the far left, / with this shady character approaching.
Eventually, Jimmy figured out / who that was / and got him to confess / to taking the cash / and dumping the wallet in this ocean channel.
It was long gone.
But you still won't let this go.
After I invested all that time, / I'm gonna find the ring.
So I hired divers / to come out the next day.
You hired divers?
Yeah, divers.
Two divers / who scoured the seabed and eventually surfaced / with a soggy wallet, / and an irreplaceable treasure.
Jimmy went so far beyond / what most of us would do / for a stranger.
And yet, even after solving the mystery, / he still felt the need to do more, / not for the woman who lost the wallet, / but for the thief who took it.
He was living in the woods, / and this is when it was 30 degrees outside, / and he hadn't eaten two days.
I could tell he wasn't a criminal.
He was just somebody who needed a little help.  / Seventeen-year-old Rivers Prather is estranged  / from his mother.
He's been trying / to make it on his own / but was homeless / the day he stumbled into Jimmy's life.
I couldn't have been luckier.
Most other people would have just, you know, / gave the footage to police, / and he chose to help me.
He's made me part of his family.
Literally part of his family.
Rivers is now staying in Jimmy's house / with Jimmy's fiance and kids.
He's got two jobs / and a bright future.
How do you say thank you / to a guy like that?
I mean, I say thank you to him every day.
I'd do anything for him.
When that wallet got stolen / by a homeless kid, / Jimmy Gilleece could have called on police, / courts, or social services, / but instead he called on the best problem solver of all: / the compassion within.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. 
The debate / over workplace temperatures is / heating up again.
The issue took center stage / during the gubernatorial debate / in New York.
So what do women, men and science have to say / about it?
Here's Nikki Battiste.
My opponent lives / in the world of fiction.
I live in the world / of fact.
There was a chill / in this debate hall Wednesday night.
¬Åckeep moving a goal post / and have a whole different set of rules¬Åc / Not from the icy exchanges / between actress-turned gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon / and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, / but from the actual temperature.
Cynthia Nixon's team says / office temperatures are notoriously sexist.
They requested / this debate hall be warmed / to 76 degrees / but it's only 69 in here / and I've got the goose bumps / to prove it.
Why is it that time again / women have to be the ones / who are freezing cold at work?
Nixon's senior advisor Rebecca Katz said / Governor Cuomo is known / for preferring brisk temperatures / and Nixon's office unsuccessfully tried / to raise the temp.
Nixon's request heated / social media Wednesday night / with the women and men sharing / their often polar opposite office temperature preferences.
I keep two jackets here.
At the Herald Public Relations firm in New York City, / we also found an office / divided by the thermostat.
You have summer on one side / and winter on the other side.
While some men use desk fans / and sported short sleeves, / we found some women bundled up / and using space heaters.
Women should know / that they are not crazy.
It's not all in their heads.
CBS News medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula says / there is a science / behind why women feel colder.
It has to do / with thermoregulation and metabolic rate / including differences.
A 2015 study found that / most office temperatures are set / using a 1960's formula / that relies on the metabolic rate / of an average man.
Dr. Narula says / men tend to be comfortable / with a temperature in the low-70's / and women in the mid- to high-70's.
Finding a point in the middle / where both men and women could be happy / would be the ideal situation.
We have our own thermostat battles / here at CBS News, / so we decided to take a look / at what the temperature is here / in our studio, / using this temperature gun / and we are getting a reading / of 72 degrees.
Nikki Battiste, CBS News, New York.
We end the week here in the Pacific north-west / with the story about a man / who is willing to do anything / for others.
Now his neighbors have done something / for him.
Here¬Åfs Steve Hartman, On the Road.
The most prominent citizen of Gresham, Oregon, / is also the most unlikely businessman.
And what is your business?
¬Åc is delivery guy.
45-year old Todd Kirnan is autistic / although a more fitting label would be workaholic.
12 hours a day, seven days a week / for almost 20 years, / Todd has been making deliveries / and doing other odd jobs / for virtually every business / in downtown Gresham.
Two for the dress lady.
Whether it's a coffee run, / or a run to the post office, / he does whatever he's asked, / or not asked.
He emptied this waste basket / at the hair salon / simply because it was full.
I like helping people, / you know, making people happy, making people smile.
In return, / people tip him, of course.
But this is so not about the money.
The smiles grow far too broad / and the hugs last far too long / for this to be a purely business arrangement.
I love you.
I love you.
No, Todd is treasured - / so much so, people in Gresham have often joked / that he should have his own statue.
He is one of the kindest, nicest people / you will meet.
He is always smiling.
He is just a big part / of this community.
He is the town basically.
Can't imagine downtown Gresham / without Todd.
Unfortunately, barring a parade in his honor, / there's only so much a community can do / to show its appreciation, / which is why / they threw a parade / in his honor.
Last week, hundreds of people lined the streets of Gresham / to pay tribute to their delivery guy.
Todd loves old TV shows / so they borrowed a Batmobile / to drive him into the center of town / where they had another surprise waiting.
Remember those jokes / about the statue?
Well those jokes are now solid bronze real.
This is a $54,000 likeness / paid for solely with cash and in-kind donations.
Thank you for everyone being here / for me in Gresham, / and I love you guys.
In most cities, / statues are reserved / for founders and war heroes.
But here in Gresham they believe / a simple passion / done with unconditional love / belongs on a pedestal, too.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Gresham, Oregon.
I think we needed / that story tonight.
Thank you, Steve.
That is the CBS Evening News for this week. I¬Åfm Jeff Glor in New York. Have a great weekend. We'll see you again on Monday. Good night.
Good evening, I¬Åfm Jeff Glor.
We¬Åfre gonna begin here / with the waves of rain / drenching neighborhoods / from the Carolinas to New England.
In Pennsylvania, / the flood has been called historic.
Some have had to escape flooded homes and cars / by boats.
Parts of the state have got / more than a foot of rain / since the downpour started on Saturday.
In the capital Harrisburg, / it is the wettest July ever.
The surrounding county has been soaked / with 78 billion gallons of water.
DeMarco Morgan is there.
Bridges are washed out, / and numerous nearby residents have been evacuated / in Hershey and Lancaster counties.
Greg Warfel witnessed the rescues / right near his home.
They were staging to rescue the people / in the houses across the creek, / because the creek had rose above the road / and they couldn't drive out.
Street signs and structures poke out of flood waters / that surround people's homes.
Hersheypark closed its doors today / and will do so again tomorrow / for the third day this week.
Nearby Knoebels Amusement Park is also closed / after flood waters rushed through.
In Maryland, / some of the crest gates / on the Conowingo Dam / were opened / to alleviate water levels / following downpours there.
And the heavy rains are bringing / damage and frustration.
A sinkhole opened up overnight / next to Priscilla Stoner's home / in Palmyra, Pennsylvania.
It's very concerning.
I mean, we're in a neighborhood / where it's just happening / and you just never know / when you're gonna wake up / and have this in your backyard.
If it collapsed / that easily overnight, / who knows what it could have done / during the day.
Today authorities recovered the body / of a man reported missing on Monday / in a creek nearby.
If you take a look at this creek / right here behind me, / this is the Swatara Creek.
And it¬Åfs expected to crest / some time before the night is out.
As for residents / who are needing help and assistance, / the Red Cross has opened up two shelters, Jeff?
Hard to believe / how this rain just keeps coming.
DeMarco Morgan, thank you.
We end tonight with a man / who has so much love / he had to build a special place / to keep it all.
Steve Hartman met him, On the Road.
Around Starkville, Mississippi, / retired mail carrier Charles Evans is known / mostly for his questionable taste / in lawn furnishings.
But we came last year / for something undeniably beautiful.
The man that with the plan.
Charles met his wife Louise / back in 1949.
When you looked at her, / it's ----- like electrical shock.
Really?
I guess it's love.
To Charles, / true love is so powerful / nothing can stop it.
That's a big four-letter word.
Nothing.
Which is why, / after she died in 2011 / after 60 years of marriage, / he decided a grave marker wasn't enough, / that their love deserved / more than a monument.
What their love needed was a museum.
And so, in a little outbuilding / behind his house, / Charles Evans built just that.
This is our memorabilia area.
Inside, he's got the shoeshine stand / he was working at / when he met her.
He's got all the music / they used to dance to.
And he's got four walls / packed solid with pictures / documenting every significant occasion.
And this was when we went out to lunch.
And most every insignificant occasion.
This was a different place at lunch.
And this, she doesn't like that one, / because I caught her laughing / with food in her mouth.
Needless to say, he wasn't getting / a whole lot of visitors, / which was fine by Charles.
This is our last dance.
In fact, we got the sense / he almost enjoyed his alone time more.
On slow days, / he would slow dance with Louise.
I guess I'm trying / to relive our life, / wouldn't you think?
Maybe.
I don't know, / it's so hard to explain, you know.
But it's not a suffering.
Memory, it's a beautiful memory, you know.
Fortunately, a lot of our viewers could relate.
Since that story first aired, / 250 people / from as far away as India / have come to see the museum.
Some even go for a spin / with the curator.
Of course, / none of these new dance partners can hold a candle / to his Louise.
But Charles says he's still happy / that people are getting the message / of his museum: / that love can never be lost / as long as it's savored.
Yeah, she was lovely.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Starkville, Mississippi.
Charles Evans / keeping that love electricity alive.
That's the CBS Evening News. I'm Anthony Mason. Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow on CBS This Morning Saturday.
Finally tonight, who doesn't love surprises?
Here's Steve Hartman, On the Road.
OK, what you want?
No matter what you order / from school cafeteria worker Debra Davis -
I have a Caesar salad.
I have chicken patty.
Chicken and rice.
Every meal comes / with the sweetie pie.
All right, sweetie pie. You're welcome.
Auntie Debra, / as she's known here at Hoover High School, / doles out a heaping helping of hospitality / every lunch hour.
You're welcome, sweetie.
And this is just her first course of kindness.
See you all tomorrow.
After serving food all day -
I come out here.
After lunch, / Debra drives her beat-up '76 Chevy Malibu / all over San Diego, / looking for hungry homeless people.
Hey, bae! How are you?
Looks like she's OK.
No, she is not.
Debra says she's never met a homeless person / who wasn't starving / for her home cooking.
Come on, tell'em over here / to come on and eat.
On this day, she served / more than 50 multi-course meals¬Åc.
You got fork.
Curry chicken and rice, / collard greens, and smoked turkey¬Åc.
¬Åc. all at her own expense.
Are you broke?
No.
I took that / as a yes.
You're spending money / you don't have.
Yes, but you don't understand the joy / that I get from feeding people.
Tomorrow, spaghetti and meat balls, OK?
Because Debra is so selfless, / recently the school district invited her down / to the auto shop, / surprised her with friends and family, / and some better wheels / to deliver those meals.
This 2014 Mazda 3 was refurbished / by an auto body class / in the district, / but to Debra, it was like mint.
I'm not used to a new car, y'all.
She was so flabbergasted, / she didn't even know where to start, / literally.
What does it mean to you / that faculty, the staff, the kids all wanted you / to have this gift.
That I'm making a difference / in their life, you know?
I was looking for my reward / in heaven / and y'all gave me a little bit / here on Earth, Hallelujah! / Heaven on Earth, / for a woman / who has always had room / in her heart / -just now - / more trunk space.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in San Diego.
And I got tinted windows.
Tinted windows even.
That is the CBS Evening News. I'm Jeff Glor in New York. I'll see you again on Monday. Have a great weekend. Good night.
As Apple celebrates / becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company, / we end tonight with its forgotten co-founder.
John Blackstone now on a man / who left Apple / with peanuts.
It's well known / that Apple started / with two guys in a garage.
But there was also a third guy: / Ronald Wayne.
The founding document / of the Apple computer company.
Wozniak, Jobs and Wayne, all signed it down there.
Right.
Wayne, a few years older / than Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, / had experience / in video games and aerospace.
He even drew / Apple's first logo.
Jobs said, / 'That's it. We're gonna form a company.' / And Woz and himself would have 45 percent each / and I would have 10 percent / as the tiebreaker.
Today, 10 percent of Apple would be worth / about $100 billion.
But instead of being fabulously wealthy, / Wayne lives modestly / in Pahrump, Nevada.
This is a long way / from Silicon Valley.
It is, indeed.
A desert town / between Las Vegas and Death Valley.
Just twelve days after I'd signed / this contract, / I have my name taken off the contract.
Twelve days?
Twelve days.
After you became one of the founders / of the Apple computer company?
That's correct.
He gave up his 10 percent of Apple / for just $2,300 / because back then in 1976, / Ronald Wayne had his own dreams.
I also knew / that I was standing / in the shadow of giants, / and as a result, / I knew I was never gonna have / a product of my own / to develop.
He went on / to design slot machines, / and to deal in stamps and collect antique guns.
Was I very successful / at it?
Not entirely, but it was fun.
He does have one regret: / that copy / of the founding document, / it's just that - a copy.
In the 1990s, he sold the original / for just $500.
In 2011, it was auctioned / for 1.3 million.
I'm looking / at all these computers here.
I don't see the name, Apple.
No.
I don't own an Apple product.
Not even an iPhone?
Not even an iPhone.
But he's still getting requests / for autographed copies / of that first Apple logo / he designed.
Those who know Apple's history know / that Ronald Wayne has a place / in it.
John Blackstone, CBS News, Pahrump, Nevada. 
Two studies out today point / to significant progress / in helping paralyzed people stand and take steps.
This new treatment may provide hope / for many Americans / who have paralysis / from spinal cord injuries.
Here's Dr. Jon Lapook / In 2011, Jeff Marquis crashed his bike / on a mountain trail in Montana, / leaving him paralyzed / from the chest down.
I was a really independent person / before I got hurt.
And that was wiped away / pretty quickly.
A once-active athlete and professional chef, / Marquis needed / constant care.
Today Marquis can walk again, / something / people with paralysis can only imagine.
He can do it / because of a remarkable new experimental device, / a type of electrical stimulator.
Here's how it works.
Spinal injuries disrupt nerve pathways / that ordinarily allow the brain / to signal the legs / to move.
In this study, / doctors implant an electrical stimulator / at the base of the spine.
When it's turned on, / the electrical signals appear to awaken / those injured nerve pathways, / allowing the brain to communicate / with the legs again.
Marquis, now 35, was one of four patients / who spent months / doing intensive physical training / at the University of Louisville Spinal Cord Injury Research Center.
He says first he got his right foot moving / and then his left.
It's certainly a welcome change / from being in a chair all the time / and uh¬Åc, kind of a ray of sunshine / in the uh¬Åc, in my prognosis.
He walked the length / of one football field / without rest, / and then almost a quarter of a mile / over a one-hour session.
It takes so much concentration that / that I don't get emotional about it / in the moment.
Until he told his parents.
I showed them the video / because I knew I wouldn't..., sorry¬Åc,  / so I knew I probably wouldn't get the words out.
Professor Susan Harkema directs / the research.
They're able to walk independently.
It's not the same / as before their injury, / but it's a significant level of recovery.
Still I need to make a lot of progress, / but I do live alone / and make a living independently.
Jeff, we used to think / that patients like Marquis had complete severing / of all the nerves / at a certain level, / but now we know / that some nerves can survive, / which is why he can think, / ''Legs, move!'' / And with a little help from technology / they can move.
Now it's probably years away / from real widespread use / but what an amazing¬Åc / I mean, how great is it / to see them walking in that video?
Amazing. All right, Jon, thank you.
We end here tonight / with a basketball player / who may have an unfair advantage / over the competition / of bigger hearts and a stronger will / than anyone on the courts.
Here's Steve Hartman, On the Road.
Every week, he set himself up / for disappointment.
Every week, 14-year-old Jamarion Styles came / to this community center / in Boca Raton, Florida, / hoping to play basketball / with the other kids.
And every week, he was rejected.
They would start picking teams / and I would be the only one left out.
And then they would tell me / just go home and stuff.
You can break someone's heart like that.
As we first reported last year, / the problem was obvious / to everyone but Jamarion.
He lost his hands and most of his arms / as an infant / due to a rare bacterial infection.
But he insisted that was no reason / to give up his hoop dreams.
What about soccer?
Have you heard of that sport?
Yeah, you would think / that I would be good at soccer.
I'm really not.
I'm horrible.
Which is why, / first day of 8th grade / here at Eagles Landing Middle School, / Jamarion took his case / to basketball coach Darian Williams, / said he wanted to be on the team.
I said, 'OK, great, / well, just make sure you try out.' / You said, 'OK, great', / but what were you really thinking?
This man has no arms, / how was he gonna play basketball?
But man, he told me, / 'Mr. Williams, I've never been on a team before.
Even if I don't play, / I just want to be on the team,' / and how could I say no to that.
And that's how the Eagles got their first, armless basketball player.
Jamarion, number two there, / quickly earned a reputation / as the hardest worker / on the squad.
He was usually the first one in the gym, / usually the last one to leave.
Still, he sat on the bench / most of the season, / until one day / the coach put him in the game / with about six minutes left.
And when he eventually got the ball / on the far side of the court, / everyone yelled, "Shoot it." / So he did, and sank / a 3-pointer.
And if you didn't quite see that, don't worry, / because shortly after, he got the ball again, / this time on the near side / for another 3-pointer, / at the buzzer.
Jamarion Styles, the kid no one would pick, / was now everyone's hero.
Since that story first aired, / Jamarion went on to play / freshman basketball, / still number two there, / and has every intention / of making varsity one day.
But here's the best part: / After hitting those threes, / Jamarion can now play all he wants / at the community center.
He's picked all the time.
Really the only thing he won't play / is the victim.
If I could wave a magic wand right now / and give you your arms back, / would you want them?
No, I don't need them.
You don¬Åft need them?
No.
Who needs hands, / when you've got this kind of touch?
Steve Hartman, On the Road in Boca Raton, Florida.
 Jamarion, you are the best.
Most of the world got to see / a total lunar eclipse tonight / for an hour and 43 minutes - / the longest of this century.
A lunar eclipse occurs / when the Earth passes / between the sun and the moon, / casting a deep shadow / over the moon's surface.
We in the U.S. did not get to see it, / but Seth Doane found a beautiful spot / in Rome.
Rome has a stunning skyline, / but tonight the real spectacle / was the sky itself.
What we are seeing is the Earth / casting its shadow / on the moon.
The Earth is blocking the sun / so the only light / it's making it to the moon / is what's reflecting / through the earth's atmosphere.
That casts a reddish glow, / creating a blood moon.
It's the longest eclipse this century: / nearly two hours.
These amateur photographers wanted to capture / every minute.
How was it to see?
It's spectacular, / I don't think I'll see again, / a thing like this, in my life.
No tickets required, / wine and olives optional.
This was a free show / with no regard for borders.
They gazed at the same moon / in Gaza, in Israel, in Egypt.
Folks peered through telescopes / in Johannesburg.
And amateur astronomers hit the streets / in Taiwan.
Of the 7.4 billion people on Earth, / about 7 billion in theory could see tonight's eclipse, / except for those / in North America and Greenland, / where time of day did not allow.
For those / who couldn't see it so well, / NASA put out a sort of "highlights" reel / to appropriate music.
The ancient Inca were said to have believed / a red moon meant / it had been mauled by a jaguar.
The Mesopotamians thought / it was a warning / their king would be attacked.
No, it's science, / orbiting planets / in perfect alignment.
Less whimsical, perhaps, / but no doubt, spectacular.
Seth Doane, CBS News, Rome.
Now the story of a little boy / in search of courage, / and a wise old man / who helped him find it.
Steve Hartman is On the Road.
It is the tallest 20 inches / in sports.
The distance / between a diving board and the surface of the water / can feel like half a body length, / especially when it's half your body length, / which is why, / all summer long, / 4-year-old Dylan Stich has been cheating the system, / gradually lowering himself / into the water / like a fragile egg.
He had no interest in it¬Åc.
His Mom¬Åc.
¬Åc. ever.
¬Åc. Marla.
You don't wanna pressure him.
Right, right. We were just saying, / 'Hey, you want to give it a shot?
You want to give it a try?' / He was no way?
Right. He wasn't interested.
Enter 95-year-old Daniel Biss.
They drafted me.
Daniel was in the Air Force / during World War II and Korea.
Radio operator.
He knows a thing or two / about fear and bravery.
So when he saw this neighborhood kid / at a family pool party in Canton, Ohio, / and heard everyone trying to coax him / off the board.
He just wouldn't go.
He knew exactly / what Dylan needed.
Just needed / some convincing, I guess.
I guess he did.
So I was gonna try, anyway.
So Daniel borrowed a swimsuit, / and with cane in hand, / stepped up / to set the example.
This is a miracle! / 'This is a miracle!' one kid yelled.
As if Lazarus himself had risen up / to the spring board.
And it did feel that way.
The great-grandfather hadn't been on a diving board / in 50 years, / and yet there he stood, / ready and willing to teach a lesson / in courage, / which almost turned into a lesson / in first aid.
Everyone kind of like held their breath / and got real nervous / like, 'Oh, was this a bad idea?' / I was, I was up to that far, / I figured / I may as well go through with it.
And so at the age of 95, he dove / for Dylan.
Not the prettiest dive / I have ever seen.
No, no, no. I could have done better.
Actually he really couldn't have done better, / because shortly after Daniel took his last jump / off a diving board, / Dylan took his first.
It was really neat that / that inspired him / to do it.
It was a neat moment.
This all happened last month, / and today Dylan jumps no problem.
Hopefully his courage will now inspire you, / with whatever leap / you need to make.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Canton, Ohio. 
The battle continues tonight / against wildfires in the West.
They destroyed / dozens of homes in California.
Out of the ashes of one of those homes / comes the story of undying love / told tonight by Manuel Bojorquez.
The flames raced down the hillside / so quickly Friday night / that Ishu and Laura Rao had no choice / but to flee / with their two girls, / but leaving behind one priceless possession.
It's just dawned on me / 'Oh, my Gosh, my wedding ring! ' / And she goes and says, / 'I left my ring, I left my ring, / should I go back and get it?' / Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
I know what it means to her / and I know what it means to me, / but I know what she means to me.
The couple married / just eight months ago.
How did you know / where the ring might be?
I knew exactly / where I left it.
I leave it in the same spot, / above the bathroom sink / in this little dish.
When they returned / to the ashes two days later, / Ishu used the pipes sticking out from the rubble / to guide him.
The diamonds were gone, / but he found the ring.
So not only did you find the ring, / you then did what?
Because looking at the ring and there she was, so / I just dropped down to a knee and proposed / and just said 'Hey, will you marry me again?' / And she said yes.
A firefighter / who was helping them search / snapped this photo.
It was beautiful, / it was so unexpected.
We don't look at it / as a charred remnant / of what could have been.
We look at it / as hope and prosperity / of what's going to be.
It just put everything into perspective, / and like, I have the man I love, / the kids are OK, the pets are OK, / and so in that dark moment / it just made things lighter.
A moment made more significant / by what they revealed just today / - Laura is eight weeks pregnant - / another new beginning.
We're gonna make everything good / out of this.
Yeah.
Manuel Bojorquez, CBS News, Goleta, California.
That is awesome.
And that is the CBS Evening News tonight. 
In the last century, / TV spy Maxwell Smart used the phone booth / to enter his top secret office.
Most booths have since been eighty-sixed / -made obsolete / by the 21st century smart phone.
But, would you believe it?
They are getting / a second life.
Mark Phillips now on the reincarnation / of the phone booth.
The British famously have trouble / letting go of old things.
The monarchy, double-decker buses, / taxi cabs / that look like they were designed / 60 years ago / because they basically were.
So when this cellphone turned / those classic red phone booths / that have been around / for about eighty years / into a waste of space, / there was a problem.
What to do with them?
As nobody was using them, / the phone company started / taking them away.
They come here / to what looks like a phone booth graveyard, / except it's not.
It's a magical transition zone / to a second life.
Your job is just to collect them?
Gather them up. (cross talk) / Get rid of them? (cross talk) / Yes. (cross talk) / A second life / given to them / by Tony Inglis.
Then you thought, / wait a minute.
Well we just can't let them go, you know. You just can't.
You just can't.
Just you can't let them go.
I don't know / what we're gonna do with them, / but we just can't let them go.
When Tony started refurbishing them, / surprise, surprise, / people started buying them.
And not just because / old phones and the funny old shillings and pence coins / they take / are fun.
So, how to¬Åc, what I do?
Push it down?
Yes, push it down.
Uuuuh! It's gorgeous! / Those booths, it turns out, / had legs.
They started showing up / around the country, / put to all sorts of new uses.
That old booth / on a village green / turned out to be a great place / to put a defibrillator.
Local libraries found them handy places  / from which to run book exchanges.
How about a coffee shop?
They are already in prime retail locations.
Or a hat stall, florist, salad bar, / or anti-social disco.
And perhaps the most ironic use: / this one operates / as a cellphone repair shop.
How's that / for recycling?
In a throw-away culture, / these are keepers.
This is a big lump / of something.
You know, something permanent / that you can touch and handle / and you feel / that there is a definite presence about it.  / Yeah, it used to be a big lump / of something.
Mark Phillips, CBS News, Surrey, England. 
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said / the time is always right / to do what is right.
Tonight, Steve Hartman is On the Road / with school kids / who decided the time was right / to right a wrong.
At the Mount Airy Resort in the Poconos of Pennsylvania, / reverend Gilbert Caldwell and his wife, Grace, are arriving / for their second honeymoon.
They were greeted warmly / - a sharp contrast to their first visit, / 60 years earlier.
In 1957 they were married in North Carolina, / then drove eight hours / only to be turned back / for being black.
How did they put it?
Did they give you a reason?
First they pretended / that I didn't have a reservation, / where I actually brought a copy.
And then of course they said, / 'but if we said yes, / our guests would be very unhappy.' / They had to stay / at a black-owned hunting lodge instead.
Men with these big guns.
Not what you were planning on / for your honeymoon?
Not what we were planning.
Prodded partly by that experience, / Gil immersed himself / in the civil rights movement, / working side by side / with Martin Luther King Jr.
Today, he speaks about the movement, / which is how he ended up at Bear Tavern Elementary / in Titusville, New Jersey, last year.
He told the honeymoon story, / as he'd done a hundred times before.
But for whatever reason, / this group of fifth graders / really took it to heart.
At the end of the story / I was like, 'that's just terrible.' / It was really heartbreaking.
Just because it's just so wrong.
I feel like this is the worst thing / that someone could do to someone.
Even months after the Caldwells' visit, / kids like Emily Asherman are still this affected.
You feel bad for them?
That they had to go through that?
A ton.
A ton.
Yeah.
Which is why / each fifth grader wrote a letter / to Mount Airy.
One said / "the Caldwells made me think about / not only standing up for myself, / but standing up for others and fixing mistakes / that were made in the world." / In closing, the kids requested / an all-expense-paid honeymoon redo, / which they got.
Makes me feel really good inside / because we know that / even though we're just kids, / we made an impact / on the world.
It was really magnificent / to know that / kids cared that much.
I should mention / that the original Mount Airy was torn down years ago.
This is a new building with new owners, / who were just so impressed with the kids / they wanted to help make it right.
Maybe¬Åc. Was this worth waiting / 60 years for?
Obviously, this does not make up / for decades of racial injustice.
But it's a step, and a sign / that we CAN get there.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in the Poconos. 
Finally tonight, if you have ever dreamed / of taking flight / like a super hero, / you may get your chance.
Here is Charlie D'Agata.
It's not a sight / you would expect to see / on the streets of London, / but few are more blown away / by the jet suit / than the man who invented it, / Richard Browning.
There's that moment / where you're off the ground, / and suddenly it's really quite liberating.
It's almost like that dream / most people seem to have / around being able to just think somewhere / and fly there.
A military man / who served with the Royal Marines, / 39-year-old Browning quit his day job / as an oil trader, he says.
Just to see / if he could do it.
But at first / getting the invention off the ground / wasn't easy.
It can reach speeds of 32 miles an hour / and an altitude of 12,000 feet.
Anyone can fly it / with training and insurance.
It's made up / of five mini jet engines / - one on the back and two on each arm, / which control direction.
In a strange way, / a bit like riding a bike.
Browning swears / he didn't set out to copy this suit / made famous in the "Iron Man" movies, / though admits there were some / "wonderful parallels." / Actually what the guys had done / to think up that character / and then do all the CGI around it, / was actually really quite, quite accurate.
Now, the dream of designing a jet suit / is nothing new, / but never before / has it been so real.
How real?
You can actually buy this one, / if you've got a spare $450,000 / rattling around in your pocket.
That's right.
On display right there / at the Selfridges department store, / alongside a virtual reality version / of how it works.
Oh, you have got to love heights! / At the moment, it's just for fun.
I'm not at all sick.
But Browning says he foresees / some practical uses, too.
For niche military applications / and niche search and rescue applications.
It turns out we do have some capability that / they didn't think was possible.
For now, / the fuel pack limits the suit / to only three or four minutes of flight.
But as the engines become more efficient, / the only direction this jet suit is headed / is up.
Charlie D'Agata, CBS News, London.
I want one.
Linds, can we get one?
We're gonna get one.
We end here tonight / with children who have very little / but they do have something / all of us have - / a birthday.
And now they have one more thing - / someone who makes sure / their birthday is celebrated.
Here is Mireya Villarreal.
Mary Davis loves / a good party.
Every month, she throws / a massive rooftop birthday party / on Los Angeles' Skid Row / where more than 2,500 homeless people live in an area / that's less than half a square mile.
When you come up on the rooftop, / it feels / like you are on top of the world.
That feeling is not one / these kids are used to.
You see everyone here is homeless.
We are in ground zero Skid Row / and children live here.
The first night Mary threw this party, / about fifteen kids showed up.
Five years later / they are expecting over 200.
Mary and her husband Ari Kadin started Worthy of Love, / a charity that believes / children without a home still deserve / a birthday party.
The couple was looking for a way / to give back / after suffering two miscarriages.
So many children in Skid Row needed to feel / important and loved.
But we didn't realize / how much joy they were gonna bring to us, / and that was so healing for me.
This is the second stay / at Union Rescue Mission / for the Randell family.
Brianna turns twelve this month / and without Worthy of Love / her birthday would be just another day.
I still want them to live / a normal life, you know?
We're in a tough situation right now.
I want them / to still be kids.
Dr. Seuss is tonight's theme - / there's cake, games, a whole lot of dancing.
And for one night / they simply get to feel / like kids again.
Last time I had a good birthday?
That's for my ninth birthday.
After watching more than 6,000 kids blow out candles / at these parties, / Ari and Mary finally had one of their own - / a little girl, / who will celebrate her first birthday / right here.
I want her to grow up / knowing like, there are kids / that don't get / everything that you have.
You also have to bless others / and bring happiness and joy / to those that need it the most.
Mireya Villarreal, CBS News, Los Angeles.
That is the CBS Evening News tonight. I'm Jeff Glor in Washington. I'll see you tomorrow from New York. Good night.
A jury in St. Louis has awarded / nearly $4.7 billion in damages / to a group of women / who said Johnson & Johnson talcum products / caused them to develop / ovarian cancer.
As Jericka Duncan reports, / the company is still battling / thousands of cases / involving its baby powder.
I hope it sends a message / to Johnson & Johnson.
61-year-old Toni Roberts believes / Johnson & Johnson talcum powder products / caused her ovarian cancer, / and a jury in Missouri agrees.
Yesterday, it ordered Johnson & Johnson / to pay Roberts / and 21 other plaintiffs / nearly 4.7 billion dollars in damages.
Their attorneys argued / the pharmaceutical company sold / and potentially still sells talc products, / like baby powder, / contaminated with asbestos / - a mineral found in talc / that has been linked to lung cancer.
Roberts said / she began using Johnson & Johnson powder products / as a teen / for feminine hygiene purposes / and was diagnosed with cancer in 2014.
I was surprised / when I developed some indigestion / and within a matter of a week or so / I was told I had ovarian cancer.
But the science / linking Johnson & Johnson's products to cancer / is mixed.
The American Cancer Society says: / "There is very little evidence / at this time / that any other forms of cancer are linked / with consumer use of talcum powder." / In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said / they were "deeply disappointed" / in the verdict / and the company "remains confident / that its products do not contain asbestos / and do not cause ovarian cancer / and intends to pursue / all available appellate remedies." / In some previous cases, / the company has successfully appealed.
CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman.
Johnson & Johnson is very confident / this will get reduced / by the judge / or reversed on appeal.
Toni Roberts says / she may not live to see / what happens next.
Her cancer is now terminal.
This is not how I wanted to / live out my life.
I wanted to spend time / with my sons, / I wanted to spend time / with my grandchildren.
Asbestos was found / in the ovarian tissue / of several of the women in this case / and Bianna, nationwide, Johnson & Johnson is fighting / about 9,000 other talc cases.
Some coming / in the next few months.
Jericka Duncan, thank you.
Officials now say / the so-called Carr Fire in northern California has destroyed / more than 1,000 homes, / making it the sixth most destructive / in California state history.
It is one of 17 large fires / burning in California.
Governor Jerry Brown has said / this very busy fire season is "the new normal." / Mireya Villarreal continues our coverage / from California tonight.
Giant flames as high as 40 feet roared / into this Lake County community, / forcing firefighters / to take quick action.
Crews rallied to save homes, / as the Mendocino Complex Fire continued to show / just how unpredictable it can be.
The winds kicked up, / the temperatures kicked up, / the humidities went down / and then we started getting / really erratic fire behavior.
This fast-moving wildfire has already charred / 140 square miles, / and it's still only 24 percent contained.
This is the easiest way / to get rid of some of the hot spots, / as they continues to pop up / over the last few days.
You attack by air / so that your ground resources are working / on other parts / where the wild fire is growing.
Further north, / in and around Redding, California, / some evacuees were allowed to return / to neighborhoods / where more than 1,000 homes were torched.
Officials have confirmed / a sixth person, 61-year-old Daniel Bush, / died in the fire.
July was a devastating month / for California.
The state has already spent / more than a quarter of its firefighting budget / for the entire season.
Today, Governor Jerry Brown sounded the alarm.
Over a decade or so, / we're gonna have more fire, / more destructive fire, / more billions / that will have to be spent on it.
All that is the new normal / that we have to face.
This is what's gonna go on / for the next few days.
Basically these ground crews coming / after the air drops have been made / and by hand / they take their tools and water hoses / and they try and check all the hot spots / to make sure / that no flare ups are possible, Jeff?
All right, Mireya, / still in California / where it is still very hot, / but conditions improving just a bit here / in the next couple of days.
We end this mid-summer night / with an update / on the story of a Christmas gift - / the gift of life.
Here's Steve Hartman, On the Road.
A good teacher will do almost anything / for a student, / but few have gone so far / as Donna Hoagland, / teacher in Marsh Pointe Elementary in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
As we first reported a few months ago, / it all started / when Donna noticed a change / in one of her fourth graders, Troy Volk.
And it did affect / his morning behavior.
And he was just shut down at times.
She suspected / there was a reason.
She suspected / there was something going on.
So she asked me / if anything had changed at home.
This is Troy's mother, Anahita.
She told Donna the truth: / that she was in stage 5 kidney failure.
She had this severe pain / almost daily, / and because she has a rare blood type, / the odds of finding a kidney donor / were slim.
When my parents told me / about the kidney failing stuff, / I was getting a little down.
What was your worst fear?
My mom not getting a kidney, ever.
As you can see, / Troy tried to keep a brave front.
Fortunately, he found a friend / in Donna.
I really just hate it.
I know, buddy.
She was there for him / every step of the way.
To think what he must go through / seeing his mom / being sick all the time, / it's not fair.
And you feel like / you could fix that.
I can.
Turns out / Donna has the same rare blood type.
So, unbeknownst to Troy's family, / she spent months researching / how to become a kidney donor, / and then called up Anahita / for the best parent-teacher conference / of all time.
I'm like, / 'What are you talking about?' / She turns around and she's like, / 'We're a match.' / How do you say thank you.
You can't. You really can't.
The transplant happened last Christmas, / and today, everyone is doing well.
In fact, Anahita recently went swimming / and camping with her son - / things she could have never done before.
The one thing / I love about my mom's kidney transplant.
What's that?
Is that we all have, get a gift, / the same gift.
It's not a gift / that can be wrapped / in a present.
It's like a miracle.
A perfect match is a miracle.
Of course the other miracle is Donna / and teachers like her / who love our children / as their own.
Cheers for mommy's new kidney! / And save us parents / every day.
Steve Hartman on the Road in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
Yeah, they do.
That is the CBS Evening News for this week. I'm Jeff Glor. Have a good weekend. We'll see you on Monday. Good night.
We end the week with Steve Hartman / and a young man's quest / to travel back in time, / On the Road.
Even in Texas, a horse only gets you so far, / which is why, / as we first reported last year, / Justin Rozier started thinking / about a car.
Specifically, he told his mom, Jessica, / he would love to have a car / - any car - / that his dad once owned.
I mean, it could have been / a 1974 Dodge Astro.
I don't even know if that's a car, / but it could have been anything / and he would have said, 'Yes.' / Why?
I know that / he wishes his dad was here.
In 2003, / Justin's dad, Army 1st Lieutenant Jonathan Rozier, died / in Iraq.
Justin was nine months old.
Today, he cherishes anything / that used to belong to his dad, / which is why he thought / it would be so cool / to have his car.
I don't know, just knowing that / he had it.
It's a whole lot different / than just any other thing, really.
Unfortunately, after Jon died, / Jessica had to sell the car - / a '99 Toyota Celica convertible / like this one.
Finding it again would be nearly impossible, / but Jessica said she had to at least try.
This is a needle in a haystack.
Well, I've seen / magical things happen on Facebook.
So she posted the old VIN number / with a note / asking for help.
And somehow that message made it all the way / to Pleasant Grove, Utah, / where local residents not only found the car.
We decided, / you know, let's see if we can buy the car.
This is Kyle Fox.
I'm not saying he is a saint, but¬Åc¬Åc / and that butterfly stayed there / for half an hour.
Now I don't even know / where I was in that.
Anyway, Kyle got donations / to purchase the car, / and then assembled a team of volunteer mechanics / to fix it like new.
All of this unbeknownst to Justin / until this very moment.
Kyle drove the car from Utah / to surprise Justin / for his 15th birthday.
Go see it! / I can't tell you / what this meant to Justin.
I mean, I really can't.
He tried to explain it to me, / but when he opened his mouth / no words fell out.
It's a link / to the past for him.
It's a big thing / for me too.
I never got to see him / come home.
So that just one moment right there was - / I think I needed that.
Obviously, this was never about a car.
No, this was about trying to push past / what you can't forget, / trying to remember / what you never knew.
And on this most American holiday weekend, / it's about appreciating - / all the layers of sacrifice.
I'm so glad / we could do this for you.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Moore, Texas.
Finally, tonight, / he's seen it all, done it all.
Now, he is sharing his wisdom / with a new generation.
Carter Evans introduces us / to Wally.
The first lesson of the day / for students at Marina Village Middle School / happens well before class.
Every morning, / 94-year-old Wally Richardson greets / parents with a wave, / and their kids / with what he calls "Wally-isms." / Be kind whenever possible.
It's always possible.
You get these kids / a fist bump every day?
Yeah. I call it "ka-knuckle." / Some of them do like this, though.
After the "ka-knuckles," / the 80-year age difference seems to disappear.
Judging others does not define who they are.
It defines who you are.
A ship in the harbor is safe, / but that's not what ships are built for, right?
What's the point / of getting them to participate?
I want them to retain something / that they can take on / in life later on.
But his own life experiences make him an expert / on what kids won't find / in a textbook.
He joined the Navy / in World War II, / was a fighter pilot / in the Korean War, / then flew for United Airlines.
But this is Wally's work now.
He is like one of the nicest adults / that I've ever met.
It all started 15 years ago / when Wally was on his daily walk.
He likes to teach life lessons / to kids this age, / before they become "too cool" to listen.
All it takes is one significant adult / in someone's life / and you can impact them forever, / and Wally is that person / for a lot of kids.
Be kind whenever possible.
It's always possible.
If they can be kind and loving / to other people / throughout life, / they won't have any trouble getting by.
It's a labor of love.
Never look down on anyone.
Unless you are helping them get up.
And as Wally would say, / "Knowing what's right doesn't mean much / unless you do what's right." / Carter Evans, CBS News, El Dorado Hills, California.
One significant adult in someone's life / and you can impact the kid forever.
That is the CBS Evening News for tonight. I'm Jeff Glor. Good night. We'll see you tomorrow. Go, Wally!
We end tonight with folks / who've discovered / the fountain of youth / in the waters of Chicago.
Dean Reynolds now with Living Stronger.
Plying the murky waters / of Chicago's Bubbly Creek, / a group of determined women defies the odds / with every stroke.
Do you think / it is lengthening your life?
The exercise?
Yes. I do. I do.
And lengthening her life is the point / for Amber Gallman these days.
I'm stage 4, / so I'll never be done / with treatment.
I'm going to be in treatment / for the rest of my life.
Amber and her friends are members / of Recovery on Water.
About 80 women in all, / ages 40 and older, / all diagnosed / with breast cancer.
Some, like Amber, have had double mastectomies / and continue in treatment.
Others are in remission.
And while rowing may seem a bit taxing / for people like them, / the benefits are apparent.
I can tell / an enormous difference / in my energy level, my outlook, my attitude.
Keeping my body / healthy and active / is my top priority now / and I'm a much happier person / for it.
I think it's a phenomenal idea.
Dr. Sarah Friedewald is an oncologist / at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
Being competitive just helps / your endorphins / and gets your body ready / to fight the next fight.
On a recent Saturday, / Amber and her mates competed / against healthy rowers / for the best time.
They didn't exactly set / any speed record.
But remember, / these women are in another race: / a competition / in which every second is precious.
Could you have imagined yourself / doing this?
No. No way.
It's opened a window / on a future / that Amber Gallman hopes to experience.
It's an amazing opportunity / to be out there / and to have the strength / to do it.
And to know that / we can do this, / it's indescribable, really.
This was her first race, / and she says / it won't be her last.
Dean Reynolds, CBS News, Chicago.
And we hope the race goes on.
A 29-year-old Tunisian man was arrested / in Cologne, Germany.
Prosecutors say he was planning an attack / with ricin - / a biological weapon / made from castor beans.
Inhaling or ingesting just one milligram / can be deadly.
The United States is trying to keep up / with ever-changing terror threats, / including attacks at sea.
Carter Evans was given access / to an assault force training mission / off the California coast.
From a hovering helicopter, / a sniper takes out an enemy combatant, / and this elite Coast Guard counterterrorism team / swings into action, / rappelling to the deck / and taking command of this ship.
CBS News rode along / for this elaborate training exercise / off the coast of southern California,  / where would-be terrorists are mixing a deadly weapon / to disperse on shore.
This 2017 Homeland Security bulletin / specifically warns about terrorists / wanting to use poisons or toxins / outside of conflict zones.
In this scenario, this is one of the bad guys.
He is wearing a protective suit, / because there's supposedly a chemical weapon aboard.
As the helicopters provide cover, / fast boats deliver / more of the Coast Guard's equivalent of special forces.
You are coming in from all angles.
Absolutely.
Captain Dwight Collins commands / the Maritime Security Response Team.
Anything you can think of / that's what the bad guys are thinking of as well / so we just prepare / for any threat that's out there.
The entire team is now on the ship.
They're gonna go inside / and try and "neutralize" the weapon.
Let's go take a look.
The team members move methodically / through the ship.
Within a minute, the would-be weapon is secured.
It looks like a pretty precise operation there.
It is.
It's highly technical.
They're taking samples of the agent / and they are gonna run tests on it / to determine what they have.
It can take up to two years of training / just to qualify for this elite team.
Member Brian Mullinax is a 16-year Coast Guard veteran.
You ever scared / when you are about to board the boat?
Once we get out here and doing it, / it's kind of adrenaline.
This is our home / and we're here to protect it, sir.
That's why we're here.
And they train for everything.
Roughly 13 million Americans are / to take a cruise this year, / and if a ship is taken by terrorists, / this team responds.
On a ship like this though, / you've got thousands of innocent people aboard.
How do you sort through them / and find the bad guys?
Very methodically.
Different size, different configuration.
The threats are now such a concern / that the Coast Guard just activated / this West Coast team.
Carter Evans, CBS News, Long Beach, California. 
A dozen FBI agents have now joined the search / for a missing University of Iowa student.
Mollie Tibbetts disappeared last week, / after she went for a jog in Brooklyn, Iowa, / about 70 miles east of Des Moines.
As Adriana Diaz reports investigators hope / the fitness tracker that she was wearing / can provide a break / in the case.
In Brooklyn, Iowa, / Mollie Tibbetts' face is everywhere, / but the 20-year-old is nowhere to be seen.
You never think you are gonna see, see your sister / on a, on a poster / with a missing sign right across it.
Her brother Jake was the last / to see Tibbetts / more than a week ago / when he dropped her off here / at the house her boyfriend Dalton Jack lives in.
Just kind of putting trust and faith / in the law enforcement.
Jack was out of town / at the time of her disappearance / and is not a suspect.
Last Wednesday, Tibbetts went out / on her usual evening run.
Search teams have fanned out in the area / and along her usual running routes.
Now, up to 15 FBI agents have joined the investigation as well / and are looking into the Fitbit / she was wearing / and her social media footprint / for clues / to build a timeline.
That takes it to a whole new level, / because we're hoping / to be able to precisely examine and know / where she was, when she was there.
Tibbetts' Fitbit could potentially give investigators / a trove of data / from the day she disappeared.
Thomas Yohannan is an expert / on data recovery.
You could actually overlay / the location data / with the real world / to find out / what exactly happened.
You are essentially trying to find a witness / to the events that happened / leading up to her missing person.
Late today, investigators told us / they have completed a timeline / of Mollie's run, / using her Fitbit data, / where her cell phone pinged towers / and where witnesses saw her running.
Jeff, their timeline ends / where she, where they think she went missing.
They don't think she left by choice / or made it back to the house that night.
All right, Adriana is in Iowa tonight for us / as the search continues. Thank you.
We end this summer night / with a bit of stargazing.
Here's Steve Hartman, On the Road.
Lubek Jastrzebski and Nancy Nemhauser of Mount Dora, Florida, / say it was the strangest thing: / They noticed / their 25-year-old autistic son, Chip, / kept opening the same art book, / kept turning to the same page / and kept staring / into the same Starry Night.
And it seemed to comfort him.
And given that / there is not a whole lot / that helps, / we have to capitalize / on whatever we can use.
Which is why they hired someone / to paint a huge, Starry Night-inspired mural / on the wall / in front of their house.
Chip loved it.
The city did not.
Last year, this citation showed up / at the door.
It said graffiti is prohibited, / and until the Van Gogh was Van Gone, / the family could be fined / as much as $250 a day, / up to the value of the house.
First I thought / it was a prank.
And then I thought / it was a mistake.
So they asked / the code enforcement officer: / which is it?
What do we have to do / to fix this?
And she said, / 'The wall has to match the house.' / You know she meant / for you to repaint the wall / to match the house.
We followed the instructions.
They did follow the instructions.
Today the wall definitely matches the house.
But despite their cynical compliance / or perhaps because of it, / the couple's legal problems only intensified.
Next, the city said / the mural needed to come down / for a second reason.
It violated / a sign ordinance.
A sign?
That was the new argument.
This is the sign.
Yeah, that's the sign.
Mount Dora Mayor Nick Girone.
A violation of the sign ordinance / based on the fact / that it had squigglies. It had¬Åc / Squigglies?
Squigglies.
Define that / for our audience.
That's one of those circles¬Åc / Oh, yeah, Van Gogh did a lot of those.
This is what / the family was up against.
Oh, my gosh! / Which is why / even though they knew / their son would be disappointed, / Nancy and Lubek almost painted it over / in surrender white.
And the turning point, for you, I think, / was when a young girl offered her allowance / to help us / to fight / to keep the mural.
Even if we lose the house, / so be it.
To Lubek especially, / the mural had become a First Amendment issue.
And eventually / the city saw it that way, too.
Last month, the mayor conceded / and publicly apologized.
To the benefit of all concerned¬Åc / Today, those once-scorned squiggles / are now a tourist attraction, / with people visiting from around the world.
Why do you think / people are drawn here?
It's very seldom / when two crazy people / are willing to lose the house.
One. Makes that one.
Freedom of speech / on full display / under the sun splashed, Starry Night.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Mount Dora, Florida.
Good for them there. Good for the family.
We told you last week about a woman / who bought a slide projector / at a thrift store / and discovered / a collection of family photos inside.
She set out to find that family, / and return their photographic memories.
Turns out / the family was watching our broadcast.
Here's Mark Strassmann.
Kristie Baeumert's $15 vintage slide projector / came with a mystery.
I love these pictures.
I feel like I know this family / at this point.
I really hope / that I get that moment / to hand them over.
Minutes after we showed you / her story last week, / a viewer contacted Kristie.
It is so very nice to meet you! / Meet 88-year-old Theda Robertson, / and her daughters Deborah and Treva.
That's your girls.
Yeah, that's my sister and I.
Kristie showed the Robertsons / photos of themselves / they hadn't seen / in 20 years.
And we were in Wake Island?
Yes.
Turns out / the Robertsons are a military family / who have lived around the world.
But the family's slide projector disappeared / years ago.
And what was it like / to see them again?
Amazing! / It's the craziest set of circumstances, right?
Yes, yes.
And now you've got it back.
And it just brings back / all the memories / that we had as children.
She purchased a projector / and then found our life's treasure inside.
And just so diligent.
I mean you did not give up / until you found us.
Right.
We thank you / from the bottom of our hearts.
Oh, you're very welcome.
Is the story you've heard today / as good as the one you imagined?
Absolutely.
And they are just as happy and joyful / and it's such a great story / just the way / I thought it would be.
As for the slide projector / that brought them all together¬Åc / Can we buy back / that slide (projector) ?
It also went home / with the Robertsons.
I absolutely want you to have this.
Mark Strassmann, CBS News, Tyrone, Georgia / That is pretty great!
We end here tonight / with a story of a police officer / sworn to protect and serve.
The other day that service included / getting a guy ready / for work.
Here's Jim Axelrod.
If "character" is what you do / when you don't know anyone's watching, / then Tallahassee, Florida, police officer Tony Carlson's character / is solid gold.
We've seen / so many negative things, / ah, reference to police / and some of the actions / that have been taken.
It's kind of nice / that something positive was caught / on film.
Last Sunday afternoon, / Officer Carlson had just finished a call / and was in a gas station parking lot, / when he came upon a homeless man / named Phil.
When I got out of my car / he asked me / if I knew anything about electric razors / and that it was broken, / he was trying to get it to work, / if I could help him.
While Officer Carlson fixed it, / Phil told him / if he could just clean himself up, / the McDonald's next door had promised him a job.
With the repair successful, / Phil then tried to shave.
He was trying, trying to shave, / obviously outside, didn't have a mirror or anything / and he was just getting patch after patch.
It wasn't going too well.
So, I said, 'Hey Phil, / do you, if you want me to do that, here / I can probably get it done / a lot quicker / than you sitting here struggling with it.' / A stranger with a cell phone saw / what was going on, / posted it on Facebook / and the good deed went viral.
When I finished with Phil, / I drove off and my wife had called me / and she said / 'Hey, did you shave some guy today?' / Tomorrow, Officer Carlson will help Phil / complete some paperwork, / and then it looks like Phil will have a job - / all thanks to a close shave / with the law.
Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.
We end here tonight / with an enduring friendship.
It began just two years ago, / yet it spans / nearly eight decades.
She is five. He is eighty three.
Steve Hartman is On the Road.
The audience / at this preschool graduation in Augusta, Georgia, / was full of parents, grandparents, / and one very good friend.
Dan Peterson is best friends / with Norah Wood.
Norah's mom, Tara, says / these two are absolutely inseparable.
She's wholly invested / in him.
She can't remember her life / before him, / and I'm not sure that / he wants to remember his / before her.
Before he met Norah in 2016, / Dan was severely depressed.
His wife had just died / and he was grocery shopping for himself / when Norah spotted him.
As you can see / on this security footage, / she just randomly reached out to him, / to this total stranger.
She stood up and said, / 'Hi, old person, it's my birthday today!' / 'Hi, old person!' / She says this / to this cranky old man?
Yeah! / And then had the audacity / to demand a hug.
I said, 'A hug?!' / And she said, 'Absolutely!' / Norah got her hug / and then asked her mom / to take a picture of her / with her new friend.
She zeroed in on him / like a missile.
And his little lip quivered / and he was teared up / and it was just sweet.
And I said, 'You don't know.
This is the first time / for quite a while / that I've been this happy.' / After we first told this story, / we thought for sure / the love would fade.
But here we are, a year and a half later, / and they are still seeing each other / at least once a week.
It's remarkable.
I mean, I think a lot of people thought / that it wouldn't continue, / but they're pure magic.
What¬Åfs the reason / you like Mr. Dan?
He¬Åfs sweet.
He¬Åfs sweet?
He¬Åfs sweet / like a peppermint.
Ooh, peppermint.
Makes you want a peppermint, / doesn¬Åft it?
Yes.
But the surest sign / of their connection / came just a couple months ago.
Norah was hugging Dan, / which she always does, / but this time was different.
I couldn't get her to let go.
Because he hadn't answered the door / right away, / Norah was just relieved / to find him safe.
Every time I see you, I get happy.
She was crying.
What's it feel like / to be loved that much?
I think you can see.
We can see.
Steve Hartman, On the Road in Augusta, Georgia.
I hope we can keep updating that story / for a long, long time.
Finally tonight, Frank Sinatra told us / love is lovelier / the second time around.
Steve Hartman found proof, / On the Road.
Lorrie Agan of Bowling Green, Ohio, is about to marry / her soul mate.
But getting to this moment was not easy.
After her first marriage ended / in a bitter divorce, / Lorrie says / she could have never imagined this.
It's a miracle / that this happened.
This doesn't happen every day / that people get a second chance / at true love.
Her first chance ended so badly / she relegated her memories of it / to a closet floor, / their eight wonderful children aside.
Lorrie says at the end / she and her ex-husband just did not mesh.
The fighting, / what the kids were witnessing.
I just didn't want / in our lives anymore.
The kids say / it was that bad.
I mean the tension in the house, / you could cut it like a knife.
We blamed ourselves.
We thought that / it was because of us.
The whole family was an absolute wreck.
But in the wake of the divorce, / Lorrie decided to fix / the only person she could: / herself.
She worked hard / to build up her self-esteem / and got treatment / for her depression.
Meanwhile, across town, / her ex-husband Jeff was going through / his own reckoning.
He sought treatment / for alcoholism / and turned his life around.
And all this self-improvement / had an unintended consequence.
Eventually, they could actually tolerate / being in the same room / at the same time.
They didn't have to have / two separate birthday parties / for each kid.
And last year, they even spent / Christmas together.
Still, not even the children knew / how close they'd become - / until Lorrie got her present / from Jeff.
It was a love poem / that ended / with a familiar ring.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, yes,yes! / Laurie had found / her soul mate, again.
There are no words to express / what I felt at that moment.
Last month, four years after their break-up, / Lorrie and Jeff got married.
They called it / a family healing ceremony.
And heal, it did.
I was just so happy / for my parents.
Especially, the children.
Just they've both come so far.
I'm just so proud of them.
We get a do-over.
Who gets do-overs / in this world?
We got a do-over.
The big thing / I would add to that is: / don't be too proud / to get help, / because some jobs are too big / for you to do by yourself.
Can I hug him?
Yes! / Sometimes we think / love is lost, / when really it's just misplaced, / and waiting / to be found.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Bowling Green, Ohio. 
We end tonight / with a medical emergency / caught on camera, / and the story of someone / who says / they were saved by a kiss.
Andi Traynor and Max Montgomery's relationship nearly ended / before it even started.
They met through Facebook.
Montgomery posted an invite / asking friends / to train with him / for a marathon paddleboard event / in New York City.
Traynor answered.
After their fourth paddle session, / Montgomery felt a burning sensation / in his chest.
I kept saying / just make it to the car, make it to the car / and I said I need to put the board down / and I just put the board down / and then boom, that was it.
Montgomery went into cardiac arrest.
He didn't have a heartbeat / for 17 minutes.
I checked for a pulse / and I didn't feel a pulse.
I first¬Åc, I just¬Åc, I thought he was dead.
That's Traynor, Dr. Andi Traynor / on her knees / administering CPR and mouth-to-mouth.
I ran 10.4 miles / the night before.
I had no idea / that I was gonna have a heart attack.
Luckily I was with someone / who knew CPR.
Without it I'm not here.
CPR kept his brain alive / so that he could be / who he always has been.
It took six defibrillator shocks / from the EMTs / to get his heart beating again, / but Montgomery says / if it wasn't for Traynor / he wouldn't be standing here today.
To me, that first kiss being CPR / was obviously very magical / because here I am / and I'm very grateful / that I'm able to experience further kisses.
I got the opportunity / to share life with him / and it doesn't seem / awkward or anything / that that was our first kiss.
The couple now sharing their story / in the hopes / of saving lives.
Anything could happen at any time to anyone, / and so we've started bringing / this kind of very 5-10 minute lifesaving instructions / to teach people / how to give CPR, how to call 911, / how to get an AED device.
We want to empower people / to do a lot of things / but especially to know / that they have the power / to save a life, too.
And can you believe / the whole incident was actually caught on camera / by a photographer / who was recording bird migratory behavior?
Well, both Montgomery and Traynor / are now certified CPR instructors teaching people / hands-only CPR.
We end here tonight / with the miracle of life / and the life-saving wonders / of medicine.
Geoff and Rachel Finn were ecstatic to learn / they were expecting a second child, / when they got news / no parent wants to hear.
Their daughter had rare congenital heart defects / that meant it was unlikely / she would survive / after birth.
That was incredibly difficult.
And I could just see / the ultrasound technician's face completely change.
And we knew / there was something wrong right away / just by the, the look on her face.
Their little girl, Ivy, was diagnosed / with hypo-plastic left heart syndrome.
Her heart wouldn't be able to pump oxygen / to her body.
She also had a condition / called intact atrial septum, / worsening her case.
But doctors told the Finns / there was a surgery / that had never been performed before / in the womb, / that might give Ivy a chance.
I was just very thankful / that there was something / that we could attempt.
Last month, the Finns moved / from their home in Jacksonville, Florida, / to Houston / where Ivy could receive care / at Texas Children's Hospital.
She was born on Friday.
It was pure joy, / when she was born.
They placed her on my chest / as soon as she was born / and I mean, she came out screaming / and that was something / that we weren't sure / we'd ever hear / and so it was, it was amazing.
It was amazing. It was amazing.
Ivy had her first open-heart surgery today -
one of three / that are planned.
I mean, our faith has been / what's gotten us this far.
And just holding onto hope / knowing that, you know, / this life isn't everything.
And so we're just thankful / for the time / we've been given so far.
And we pray that / we have many, many years ahead of us / with her.
Yeah, we've kind, we kind of made almost a pact / since we found out the diagnosis / that we kind of said, / 'Ivy, if you live for 10 seconds / or if you live for 100 years, / we're gonna be there and loving you / with all of who we are / throughout the entire time.' / We just spoke / with the Finns again tonight, / they say Ivy's surgery was successful today.
She's back in the ICU tonight, / recovering and preparing / for the next step / in her journey.
We will keep you posted for sure.
That is the CBS Evening News for tonight. I'm Jeff Glor. We'll see you tomorrow. Good night. And go Ivy.
Tonight Steve Hartman does a deep dive / and finds the key to success, / On the Road.
They were the Bad News Bears / of swimming.
In fact, coach Alex Weidemann / of Seguin High School in Arlington, Texas, says / you can't overstate / their underachievement.
Our goal every meet / was to finish the race.
Just get across the pool?
Get across the pool.
Really, we measured our success / on not getting disqualified.
And because that was the standard, / four years ago, Gerald Hodges made the team / - perhaps the only kid / to ever make a high school swim team / without a clue / how to swim.
We had to get anybody.
It didn't matter.
He couldn't get across five yards, / let alone 25 yards.
Was there really nobody better?
No.
Eventually, he at least learned / how to not drown, / and even finished some races, / albeit long after the other competitors were done / and toweled off.
Yes, he was that bad.
Which is interesting, / because on dry land, / Gerald is a remarkable athlete.
Could you have made / the basketball team?
I think so.
Could you made the football team?
Ahm, Pretty sure.
Soccer team?
Pretty positive.
So why swimming?
I felt like / if I couldn't handle / not being good at something, / then how could I consider myself, you know, / a successful person.
That quote bears repeating: / If I couldn't handle / not being good at something, / then how could I consider myself / a successful person.
To Gerald, setting yourself up / for failure / is actually the key / to future success.
Especially if you can somehow manage / to master your weakness.
And by the start of his senior year, / Gerald had actually improved a lot.
But no one really knew / how much he'd improved / until a big regional meet / earlier this year.
It was the 200-yard medley relay.
Top two teams qualify for state, / and as usual, / Seguin was pretty much in last place / with 50 yards to go.
And that's when Gerald jumped in the water.
Keep in mind, at this level, / making up any significant time / is nearly impossible.
Unless maybe you've got / something to prove.
Unless, maybe, there's an extra drive / deep within anyone / who knows what it's like / to be dismissed.
Whatever it was, / the kid who couldn't swim, / just sent his team to state.
Man, it was ecstatic.
I could barely contain my energy / as I was trying to go get this medal! / I'm sitting here / just freaking out! / You're having a hard time now.
Yes, like, exactly¬Åc Yeah, / I was like, I've come so far.
From now on, / whenever you think / anything is impossible, / think of Gerald.
Whenever you think / America has lost its heart, / think of Gerald.
Steve Hartman, On the Road, in Arlington, Texas.
Oh, baby. That is awesome.
Over the years, / many people have dreamed / of going to California.
At first, / the dream was to find gold.
In 1848, / a man named James Marshall was working / at a sawmill.
It was on the American River, / about one hundred kilometers northeast of San Francisco.
He found a piece of bright metal / where the river flowed / through the sawmill.
It was gold.
People / who rushed to California / the following year, 1849, / became known as "forty-niners." / A few found gold and became rich.
The people who stayed made homes / for themselves.
In 1850, California became a state.
California became the dream / of many people / in the cold, crowded cities / of the East and Middle West.
Today, California is still a land of dreams.  / People want to live there / because of the warm weather and sunshine.
There are beautiful ocean beaches and mountains.  / There are jobs / in the cities and on farms.
But the weather and the forces of nature in California / are sometimes dangerous.
For example, earlier this month / there were many days of heavy rain / in normally dry southern California.
Mudslides that resulted killed / at least 10 people / in the Pacific Coast town of La Conchita.
Earthquakes are always a possible threat / in California.
In 1906, / an earthquake destroyed the city of San Francisco.
It killed / hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people.
More recently, / a powerful earthquake in 1994 shook Southern California.
The quake killed about sixty people / in the Los Angeles area.
It caused twenty thousand million dollars in damage / to buildings and roads.
Scientists also say / a huge and destructive tsunami wave is possible / from the Pacific Ocean.
Yet another problem is fire.
Dry winds race / across the desert / into Southern California / in the fall.
Any fire can suddenly become / a major wildfire.
But danger from nature does not seem to keep people / from moving to California.
The estimated population grew / almost five percent / between 2000 and 2003.
Some newcomers dream of Hollywood.
They come to find a job / in the movie capital of the world.
But these young men and women are like the early settlers / who searched for gold.
Only a few ever become movie stars / or successful writers, directors or producers.
Stevie Wonder released a music video last week / designed especially for blind people.
The song is called "So What the Fuss." / Gwen Outen tells about the project / and plays some of Stevie Wonder¬Åfs music.
The music video itself is not unusual.
It shows / scenes of city life.
Teenagers sit and laugh / on the front steps of a house.
Young people dance / at a party / in an apartment nearby.
People push a broken car / out of the street.
And, of course, Stevie Wonder plays the piano / as he sings.
But, there is also the voice / of rapper Busta Rhymes.
He describes the action / in the video.
This special sound over video recording is called / video description technology.
Experts / at a public television station / in Boston, Massachusetts / developed the idea / in 1990.
They wrote the narration / for the new music video.
Stevie Wonder is blind.
He says / ten million blind or low vision Americans are not able to enjoy / watching music videos.
Now he says / all his fans will be able to enjoy / his video.
Prince plays guitar / on "So What the Fuss." / The group En Vogue sings back up.
The song will be on Wonder¬Åfs new album, "A Time To Love," / to be released next month.
It joins / 35 other Stevie Wonder records.
Here is one of his early hit songs, "Uptight (Everything¬Åfs Alright)." / In 1976 Stevie Wonder released / one of his best-loved albums, "Songs in the Key of Life." / We leave you now / with a popular song from that recording, "Sir Duke."
Sunday, May 8, is Mother¬Åfs Day / in the United States.
It is a special day / when Americans honor their mothers.
Faith Lapidus tells us about it.
Writer Julia Ward Howe made the first known suggestion / for a Mother¬Åfs Day / in the United States.
That was in 1872.
She said it should be a day / to celebrate peace.
For several years, / she held a yearly Mother¬Åfs Day meeting / in June in Boston, Massachusetts.
Mother¬Åfs Day as it is celebrated now began / with a woman named Anna Jarvis.
She started a campaign / for a national observance / in the early 1900s.
She wrote thousands of letters / to public officials.
She urged / that the second Sunday in May be declared / Mother¬Åfs Day.
In 1914, / President Woodrow Wilson and the United States Congress finally agreed.
After that, / the second Sunday in May became a day / to express love for mothers / throughout the country.
On Mother¬Åfs Day, / children of all ages give their mothers / special gifts.
Popular gifts include / flowers, jewelry or candy.
Children also do nice things / so their mother will not have to do any work / on her special day.
They might bring her breakfast in bed / or clean the house.
Children / who no longer live at home / may travel to visit their mother / on Mother¬Åfs Day.
The whole family may go to a restaurant / for a holiday meal.
Children / who cannot be with their mother on the holiday / send a special card / with a message of love.
They also call their mother on the telephone / to wish her a happy day.
Mother¬Åfs Day is one of the busiest days of the year / for telephone use / in the United States.
So, you may ask, / "do Americans have a special day / to honor their fathers?" / The answer is yes.
Father¬Åfs Day is in June, / but that is a story / for another time!
American pilot Steve Fossett flew / around the world last week.
He made the flight alone / and without stopping for fuel.
He spent sixty-seven hours and one minute / in the air.
Bob Doughty has our story.
Steve Fossett likes / to set records.
Before last week / he held sixty-two international records / for flying and sailing.
His earlier best-known flight record / was for traveling around the world, alone, / in a balloon.
The aircraft / he used last week / is called the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer.
This experimental aircraft has / one jet engine / and carries nine tons of fuel.
Its wings are almost forty-four meters long.
The GlobalFlyer cost / one-and-one-half million dollars.
The money came from Richard Branson, / the British businessman / who owns Virgin Atlantic airlines.
The flight began / in Salina, Kansas, / in the middle of the United States.
Organizers of the flight chose that city / because its airport has a very long runway.
The experimental aircraft needed / an extra long runway / to take off / because of the weight of its fuel.
Steve Fossett took the aircraft / to 14,000 meters.
The sixty-year-old pilot used the strong winds / at that height / to gain speed and save fuel.
Several hours into the flight, it appeared / that the plane had a fuel shortage.
But Mr. Fossett and the ground controllers could not tell / if the fuel was gone / or if the instruments were wrong.
Ground control told Mister Fossett / that he would have to make a decision / about continuing the flight / when he reached Hawaii.
As he neared the islands, / the strong winds / that helped carry the GlobalFlyer / increased.
Steve Fossett decided / to continue his attempt.
Those winds continued to help the GlobalFlyer / on its return to Salina.
Mister Fossett had little sleep / during his sixty-seven-hour flight.
He says / he has more projects / in the planning.
As of last week, / all he needed was recognition / from the National Aeronautic Association.
Then he could claim the record / for the fastest non-stop, non-refueled trip ever made / around the world.
What business / that began with one eating place / in the American Midwest / now has 30,000 fast-food restaurants / all over the world?
The answer is McDonald¬Åfs, / which celebrated its 50th anniversary / earlier this month.
Barbara Klein has more.
Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald¬Åfs / in Des Plaines, Illinois, near Chicago, / on April 15, 1955.
Before starting McDonald¬Åfs, / Mr. Kroc sold machines / that mixed milk and ice cream / to make a popular drink / called a milkshake.
The new restaurant sold hamburgers / and fried potatoes / called French fries also.
McDonald¬Åfs workers prepared this food / very quickly.
People waited only a few minutes / for their food.
That first McDonald¬Åfs was torn down / in 1984.
The company built a copy of it / in the same place / to serve as a McDonald¬Åfs Museum.
It contains the equipment / used to prepare food / during the restaurant¬Åfs first days of operation.
On the bottom floor of the museum, / visitors can see early advertisements, / other McDonald¬Åfs objects / and a short movie about the company.
The museum does not sell food, however.
Visitors can go across the street / to eat at a modern McDonald¬Åfs.
Today, 30,000 McDonald¬Åfs restaurants / in more than 100 countries / serve food / to almost fifty million people each day.
But McDonald¬Åfs has many critics.
They say the company pays its workers / too little.
They also say the restaurants serve food / that is not healthy / because it contains / too much fat and sugar.
Last year, an American filmmaker ate nothing / but McDonald¬Åfs food / for one month.
He made a movie / about his experience / called "Super Size Me".
Doctors who examined the young man found / that eating McDonald¬Åfs food had damaged his health.
The food caused weight gain, / increased blood pressure and cholesterol / and damage to his liver.
After the movie¬Åfs release, / McDonald¬Åfs announced / that it would stop selling / extremely large meals.
During its 50 years, / McDonald¬Åfs has added more kinds of foods.
It still sells / milkshakes, French fries and hamburgers.
But it has added salads, / chicken sandwiches, yogurt, and breakfast food.
Makenzie Snyder is a teenager / who leads an organization / that helps displaced children / in the United States.
Faith Lapidus tells us / about Makenzie and the organization she started.
Makenzie Snyder lives / in Bowie, Maryland.
She was seven years old / when she started Children to Children.
The organization helps children / in foster care.
Foster care is the name of a system / used when parents are no longer able / to take care of their children.
The children are placed / in the homes of people / who have agreed / to care for them.
More than 530,000 children / in the United States / are now in foster care.
Makenzie met two children / in foster care / in 1998.
They had moved / from home to home.
Makenzie learned / that many foster children have nothing / in which to carry / their clothes and other personal objects.
They are given plastic bags / made for carrying waste or trash.
Makenzie says she thought / it was wrong / for children to have to treat their belongings / as if they were trash.
With help from her parents, / she started an Internet Web site / and the organization Children to Children.
Children to Children helps children / in the foster care system / to feel better about themselves / during times when their families are in crisis.
The organization provides / high quality travel bags / for the children¬Åfs clothes.
The children also receive / a soft toy animal.
Makenzie says this gives them / something to hug and to love.
She says the toy helps the children / to not feel alone.
She also writes a note / to each child.
She tells them / that they should never lose hope / and that she loves them.
Makenzie Snyder is now fourteen years old.
She continues her work / with Children to Children / after seven years.
She says her goal is to help all children / in foster care / in the United States.
Children to Children has provided / about 30,000 bags / to children in need.
The experts / who work with the children / say Makenzie is doing a good job.
They say the children are happy / to receive her gifts.
Makenzie Snyder has won many awards / for her work.
She says she would like to meet / the children she helps.
But she is not permitted / to do so.
American laws protect the names of children /  in foster care. 
That song, "Hound Dog," was / one of Elvis Presley¬Åfs most popular records.
It sold five-million copies / in 1956.
Music industry experts say / more than one-thousand-million of Elvis¬Åfs recordings have sold / throughout the world.
He was a success / in many different kinds of music / -popular, country, religious, and rhythm and blues.
Elvis Aaron Presley was born / in the southern town of Tupelo, Mississippi / on January 8, 1935.
After high school, he had several jobs, / including driving a truck.
In 1953, he made his first recording, / of this song, "My Happiness".
The story is that / he paid four dollars / to make a recording / for his mother.
A woman / who worked at the public recording studio / had another job / with a local independent record company / called Sun Records.
She made a second recording of Elvis¬Åfs songs / because she thought / the owner of Sun Records should hear him sing.
The owner of Sun Records, Sam Phillips, / had been looking for a white performer / who could sing black rhythm and blues.
He suggested Elvis / work with a guitar player and a bass player.
Several months later Mr. Phillips agreed / to have the group make a record.
It was released / on July 19, 1954.
One of the songs was "That¬Åfs All Right".
The record sold well in Memphis,  / and was played a lot / on local radio stations.
To let others hear Elvis, / Sam Phillips organized a series of performances / at country fairs in the area.
By the middle of the 1950s, / Elvis Presley was known around the world / as the young man / who moved his hips in a sexual way / as he sang rock and roll music.
Many adults said / he and his music were bad influences / on young people.
Young women loved him.
Huge crowds attended his performances.
Hundreds of thousands of people still visit his home, Graceland, in Memphis / every year.
Fans continue to buy his music, / making him the most popular recording artist ever.
Elvis Presley remains the undisputed King / of Rock and Roll.
"Gone with the Wind" was released / in 1939.
Experts still consider it / one of the best American movies / of all time.
It was one of the longest films / ever made, / at three and one-half hours.
It was also one of the most costly / at the time.
It cost more than four million dollars / to make.
The movie is based on a book / by Margaret Mitchell / published in 1936.
Producer David O. Selznick bought the film rights / to the book / soon after.
The book and movie told about people / living in the South / during and after the American Civil War / in the 1860s.
The characters must deal / with war, survival, love, disloyalty / and changes to their way of life.
"Gone with the Wind" broke records / for Academy Awards.
It won eight Oscars, / including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress.
Actress Hattie McDaniel became the first African American / to be nominated / for an Oscar.
She won for her performance / in a supporting role.
The movie was not made easily, however.
It had several different directors, / although only Victor Fleming won the Oscar.
Fifty actors had speaking parts.
Thousands of other people were used / for crowd and battle scenes.
Vivien Leigh won the Oscar for Best Actress / for her performance as Scarlett O¬ÅfHara.
She had been chosen / for the part / over many other actresses.
But Vivien Leigh was no southern belle.
In fact, she was not even American.
She was a British citizen / born in India.
Vivien Leigh was only 26 / when she became Scarlett O¬ÅfHara.
Clark Gable played Rhett Butler / in "Gone with the Wind." / Gable was born in Ohio / in 1901.
He became one of America¬Åfs most popular actors / in the 1930s and 40s.
Clark Gable was tall and very good-looking.
He did both comedy and drama well.
Some people were surprised / when Clark Gable did not win the Best Actor Oscar / for "Gone with the Wind." / But then, he already had one.
The industry had honored him in 1934 / for his performance / in the movie "It Happened One Night."
Disney World is the work / of American movie producer Walt Disney.
He first produced animated movies / known as cartoons.
A cartoon is a series of drawings / on film.
In a finished movie, / cartoon people and animals appear to move.
They speak with voices / recorded by actors.
Walt Disney¬Åfs cartoons were a huge success.
He created imaginary creatures / that are still popular today.
They include Mickey Mouse, / Donald Duck, Dumbo and Bambi.
Later, he produced / live action films and television shows.
In 1955, Walt Disney opened / the Disneyland entertainment park / near Los Angeles, California.
It re-created places / from Disney movies.
It also showed places / as Walt Disney imagined them, / like a town in the old American West / and a world of the future.
Disneyland was so successful / that Walt Disney planned a second park, / Walt Disney World.
It opened / near Orlando, Florida in 1971, / five years after Walt Disney died.
It is larger than Disneyland / and has more activities.
It includes an amusement park, / hotels, campgrounds, golf courses and shopping villages.
Later, Disney World added more theme parks, / such as the Animal Kingdom and EPCOT, / the Experimental Community of Tomorrow.
EPCOT Center opened / in 1982.
It includes places / that represent the cultures / of eleven countries / around the world.
For example, the area called Britain includes / a drinking place, a park / and shops / that sell British products.
At night, people gather around the lake / at EPCOT Center / and watch a fireworks show.
EPCOT also includes examples / of technology today / and in the future.
Its newest ride, called Mission Space, re-creates / a space launch.
Today, Walt Disney World is considered / the most popular vacation place / in the world.
The Disney Company also operates similar parks / in Europe and Asia.
This year, / the Disney Company is celebrating the 50th anniversary / of the opening of Disneyland.
The company says / every Disney park around the world will celebrate / with new attractions and shows.
In August of 2003 we had a story / about Pale Male, / a famous bird / living in New York City.
Recently, he and his mate Lola were in the news again.
Maybe you heard about it.
Faith Lapidus tells us more.
Pale Male and Lola are red-tailed hawks, / large hunting birds / that eat small animals and other birds.
Pale Male built a nest / on the side of a tall building.
This is a building / where people live in apartments / that cost millions and millions of dollars.
It is across the street / from Central Park, / a nature area / in the middle of the city.
Pale Male arrived in 1993.
Since then, he and his mates have raised / more than twenty young hawks.
Thousands of people have watched the activity.
The hawks became movie stars.
But recently, / the people who own the building decided / they no longer wanted the nest / on the side of their property.
They said they were tired / of finding dropped remains of pigeons / and other creatures / near the front of the building.
They ordered workers / to take down the nest.
They also ordered the workers / to fix the building / so the nest could not be rebuilt.
Other New Yorkers immediately began to protest.
Hundreds of people demonstrated / outside the building along Fifth Avenue.
The story of Pale Male made news / far beyond New York.
People around the world wrote letters / of protest.
We are happy to report / that the building owners quickly changed their minds.
They ordered workers / to undo the changes to the building, / so the hawks can rebuild their nest.
Bird watchers say / Pale Male and Lola continue to fly / around the area.
They have been seen several times / where their nest used to be.
However, the bird watchers say / the two hawks have not yet begun / to rebuild their home.
May 18, 1980, was a beautiful Sunday morning / in the small town of Ellensburg, Washington.
Fifteen-year-old Scott Johnson was reading a book / near his home.
His twelve-year-old sister Leslie was playing / with a basketball.
As Scott read, he looked up / to see a huge, black cloud / far away to the west.
It might rain, he thought.
Soon, he heard / what sounded like a big gun.
The sound seemed to grow louder.
He looked up again.
This time, he saw a huge cloud / moving quickly across the sky.
The two children watched / as the sky grew darker.
The cloud began to block light / from the sun.
Scott again looked / at his book.
He noticed something unusual / on the book.
It looked like very fine dust.
How strange, he thought.
It is raining dust! / Scott and Leslie ran into the house / and told their parents / about what they saw.
They turned on the television.
They saw the first reports / about the explosion / of Mount Saint Helen's.
The cloud beginning to cover the sky was ash / from the volcano.
It had quickly reached Ellensburg / from the volcano / more than 300 kilometers away.
Scott looked outside the house again.
The ash now covered the ground.
It was a frightening experience.
He wondered, "Will the ash bury us?" / The volcano had been giving warnings / for three months.
These warnings were in the form / of many small earthquakes.
Scientists have learned much / about volcanic activity / since Mount Saint Helen's exploded / 25 years ago.
More than twenty smaller explosions were observed / at the volcano / between 1980 and 1986.
Scientists also have been watching / recent activity there.
One thing they have learned is that / a volcano can come very close to exploding / without giving any warning.
They also learned that / volcanic activity can continue for years / without any explosions taking place.
Earlier, we told / how Scott Johnson was concerned / 25 years ago / that the ash from Mount Saint Helen's might cover his home.
That did not happen, / although the ash was deep / in some parts of town.
It had to be removed / from streets and from the tops of houses.
Travel was almost impossible / for several days.
Today, Scott Johnson is an engineer / in Seattle, Washington.
Leslie Johnson is a medical doctor / in Portland, Oregon.
Both say / the Mount Saint Helen's explosion was an experience / they never will forget.
Welcome to THIS IS AMERICA, in VOA Special English.
Come with us today / as we visit some people / who lead a simple life: / the Amish in Pennsylvania.
A visit to parts of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, / is like a trip back in time.
People live / in simple farmhouses.
Family members, including small children, all work / in the fields.
Crops are planted and harvested / without modern farm technology.
Most Amish people are easy to recognize.
The women make / their own long, dark-colored dresses.
They cover their hair / with white cloth hats, / called prayer caps.
They do not wear jewelry.
The men grow long beards.
They wear black clothing and dark hats.
The Amish live / much like their ancestors did.
Modern things / like electricity, central heating and indoor water pipes / are not considered necessary.
The Amish do not drive cars.
Instead, they travel in buggies / pulled by horses.
You meet many Amish people / in Lancaster County.
It is a popular place / for visitors.
Between now and November, / even more are coming.
Lancaster County is marking the 20th anniversary / of a famous American film, "Witness." / Many people learned about the Amish / and their ways / from this movie / by director Peter Weir.
Some Amish, however, said / the story misrepresented them.
Harrison Ford plays / a city policeman.
He stays with an Amish family / as part of an investigation.
"You have no right to keep us here." / "Uh¬Åcyes I do.
Your son¬Åfs a material witness to a homicide." / "You don¬Åft understand.
We want nothing to do with your laws." / "Doesn¬Åft surprise me.  / Lot of people I meet are like that." / One of the scenes in the movie shows / a barn-raising / in which men from the community put up a farm building.
"Hurry up now¬Åc  / we have a barn to raise and a day to do it." / The barn-raising in the film looks real / -because it was.
Local workers played the parts / of the Amish in the movie / and built a barn.
But the filmmakers brought in heavy equipment / so they could speed up the work.
If you have a few hectares of land, / it might be a good place / to raise sheep.
Some years ago, / the magazine Organic Gardening, / from the Rodale Institute research center, / offered several reasons / to consider.
Sheep can be raised / for their meat.
They produce milk / which can be made into excellent cheese.
Sheep have wool / which can be made into weaving material.
The wool is cut off / once a year in the spring.
Sheep eat grass.
They are good, natural grass cutters.
And, sheep provide a good supply of waste / that can be used / to fertilize the vegetable and flower garden.
In fact, / sheep manure contains / more nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium / than horse or cow manure.
The report in Organic Gardening offered some advice / from a field crop expert / in New York State named Carl Bannon.
He said / it is possible / to raise as many as eighteen sheep / on one hectare.
And, he said / it is not necessary / that the land be completely covered / with grass.
A mixture of grass and trees will do.
Mister Bannon said / the sheep will keep the grass cut low.
They will even eat weeds and the remains of crops / harvested from your garden.
The waste they leave behind / will add nutrients to the soil.
The manure can be collected and spread / in the garden.
Sheep manure is not like that of cow¬Åfs.
It does not have a bad smell.
It is like waste produced by rabbits, / only there is more of it.
You should not plan to become rich / selling the wool / of your sheep.
But, you may be able to sell the wool / to people in your area / who weave clothes or other things.
Or, you can send it / to a company / that will clean it and prepare it / for you to use.
There are many different kinds of sheep.
Your choice of which kind to raise / should depend / on your plans for them.
For example, / Dorset sheep are good milk producers.
Suffolk sheep are raised / for their meat.
Rambouillet sheep produce fine wool / that is prized by cloth makers.
If you decide to begin raising sheep, / you need to choose the right kind / for the weather in your area.
But you do not need to provide / much shelter / from the weather / for adult sheep.
Just be sure to provide a secure fence / to keep dogs from attacking the sheep.
And there are other considerations / before you go out and buy a sheep.
For one thing, / it might be a good idea to make sure / that the local laws permit / people in your area / to have farm animals.
Shigeru Ban is called / the "paper architect." / Mister Ban is an architect in Tokyo / known for his designs / of temporary shelters made of paper.
Many of his designs, / such as the "Paper Log House," / are built / with used cardboard tubes.
Mr. Ban designed such houses / for people in Kobe, Japan, / after the 1995 earthquake there.
He also designed / a community gathering place.
More recently, / his paper houses provided shelter / for people in Turkey and India / after earthquakes hit those countries.
Shigeru Ban also has worked / with the United Nations / to create housing / for refugees in Rwanda.
And he has established a non-governmental organization / called the Volunteer Architects¬Åf Network.
Members design buildings for free / to help deal with housing shortages / and poor living conditions / around the world.
In April, / the University of Virginia honored Mr. Ban.
He received / the Thomas Jefferson Medal in Architecture.
The school recognized him / for his humanitarian efforts, / environmental concerns / and creative use of building materials.
Shigeru Ban does not just work with paper.
He also works with bamboo, / wood and other materials.
His next project is in Sri Lanka.
The plan is to build one hundred houses / for people who lost their homes / in the tsunami waves last December.
The houses will be built / with locally made blocks / formed from earth.
Mr. Ban does not just design houses.
One of his works is a temporary space / with walls / formed from 148 shipping containers.
These steel containers are normally used / to transport goods.
Huge paper tubes support a roof / over the structure.
Shigeru Ban designed the space / as a museum / for a traveling art show / by New York photographer Gregory Colbert.
Mr. Colbert wanted an unusual place / to show his collection / of large pictures of animals / interacting with humans and nature.
The show is called "Ashes and Snow"; / the structure is the Nomadic Museum.
The Nomadic Museum is at Pier fifty-four in New York City / until June 6.
Next stop is the Santa Monica Pier / in Southern California.
As the show travels, / the shipping containers for the walls will be found locally.
Organizers say / additional stops are planned / in the United States, Europe and Asia.
Our question this week comes from a listener / in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Inamullah Mohmand asks about the announcers / for Special English programs.
He wonders / if all of them are from the United States.
And he asks / which American state accent is considered / the standard for English pronunciation / in the United States and on the program.
These questions are complex! / We decided to find out more / from our announcers.
Gwen Outen is one of the newest voices / in Special English.
She was happy to tell us / a little about her background.
Gwen was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
But she was raised in Nashville, Tennessee.
That is the traditional home / of country music / at the Grand Ole Opry.
Gwen is the first to admit / that she has a Southern, country accent.
But Gwen tries not to speak with an accent / when she is on the radio.
She likes to present a more neutral sound / on the air.
However, this does not mean / that different accents are unacceptable.
Former Special English announcer Mary Tillotson / has a clear southern accent.
And, Shirley Griffith has a very apparent northern accent  / that comes all the way from Canada / where she was born.
Shirley has lived in the United States / most of her adult life.
But, you can still hear the Canadian accent / in words like "house" and "about." / And, now, a little about me, / one of the oldest / ¬Å|or, let us say, more experienced¬Å| / Special English announcers.
I come from Milford, Delaware.
My accent is referred to / as "Eastern Shore." / They call people from my area / "hitiders" or high tiders.
We come from "Delware" or Delaware.
Like Gwen, I try to keep my sound neutral / when I broadcast.
But, my accent slips in sometimes.
There are just some words / I do not know how to say any other way, / even on air.
But, I am not going to tell you / those words.
I do not want you to notice / in the future!
Our VOA listener question this week / comes from Vietnam.
Myle asks about the history / of April Fool¬Åfs Day on April first.
Today is April Fool¬Åfs Day / in the United States.
It is not an important American holiday / like the Fourth of July or Labor Day.
It is not observed / by schools or the government.
It is just a day / when people play tricks / on each other.
History experts say / people have been doing this / for a long time.
They also say / it is difficult to know / how it began.
Some believe / the tradition comes / from the ancient Romans / more than two thousand years ago.
Others say / the day for fooling began / in France in 1564 / when King Charles changed the yearly calendar.
He moved New Year¬Åfs Day / from April first to January first.
Many people did not know / about the change / because of the communications problems / in those days.
Others knew / about the change, / but refused to accept it.
So some people continued / to celebrate New Year¬Åfs Day / on April first.
Other people called them / April Fools / and played jokes on them.
The French called them / "poissons d¬Åfavril" or "April Fish" / because young fish are easily caught.
This tradition later spread / to other countries / like Britain.
The early settlers / from Britain / brought April fooling / to the American colonies.
Americans today still play tricks / on each other / on April Fool¬Åfs Day.
Children might put signs / on the backs of their friends / that say "kick me" or "hit me." / They might tell their friends / that school has been cancelled.
Or they might go to a house, / ring the doorbell, run away, then yell "April Fool¬Åfs!" / when the homeowner comes to the door.
We found a Web site / that claims to list / the top one hundred April Fool¬Åfs Day jokes / of all time.
Maybe you remember this one.
It took place / on April first, 1996.
The Taco Bell fast food company made an announcement / in newspaper advertisements.
It said it was buying / the famous Liberty Bell / from the federal government / to help reduce the national debt.
The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, / is one of America¬Åfs most historic treasures.
The company said / it was re-naming it / the "Taco Liberty Bell." / Many people did not realize / it was a joke.
Hundreds of angry people called / the National Historic Park in Philadelphia / to protest the action.
A few hours later, / Taco Bell admitted / its April Fool¬Åfs joke!
Have you heard the old saying / that laughter is the best medicine?
Then listen to this.
Seriously, research has already shown / that mental stress can restrict blood flow / to the heart.
But now a study has linked laughter / to increased blood flow.
Laughter appears to cause the tissue inside blood vessels / to expand.
As a result, laughing may be important / to reduce the risk of heart disease.
So says Dr. Michael Miller / of the University of Maryland Medical Center.
He led a study / of twenty men and women, all healthy.
To get them to laugh, / they watched part of the movie "Kingpin," / a 1996 comedy.
To create the opposite emotions, / they watched the opening battle / in the 1998 war movie "Saving Private Ryan." / The researchers used ultrasound technology / to measure changes / in blood flow / through an artery in the arm.
Blood flow increased / in 19 of the 20 people / after they watched "Kingpin." / The increase was an average of 22 percent.
Dr. Miller says that is similar / to the effects of aerobic exercise.
Blood flow decreased / in 14 of the 20 people / after they watched "Saving Private Ryan." / The decrease was an average of 35 percent.
Studies have shown / that stress can reduce the body¬Åfs ability / to fight disease.
When the body is under stress, / it produces hormones / such as adrenalin and cortisol.
Cortisol is related to fear; / adrenalin prepares the body / to react.
But too much of these hormones can be harmful.
Dr. Miller noted / that the study could not explain / how laughter is responsible / for the effects observed.
Do the effects come / from the movement of muscles, / or from a chemical release?
The researchers say / laughter may cause the body / to release pleasure chemicals, / just as when a person exercises.
Dr. Miller says / these endorphins may block the effect / of stress hormones / and cause the blood vessels to expand.
Laughter may also influence the release / of nitric oxide, / which too expands blood passages.
Dr. Miller does not advise people / to replace exercise with laughter.
But, based on the results, / he does suggest / fifteen minutes of laughter each day.
Here is something new: / people are listening to radio / without using a radio.
They are also producing radio shows / to broadcast on the Internet.
It is called podcasting.
Phoebe Zimmermann explains.
Podcasting is also called / personal radio.
A person / who has a computer and a special microphone / can record a radio show / about anything.
This technology is new / because listeners can put the recording / on portable electronic devices / and listen to them / away from the computer.
The name podcasting came / from one of these portable electronic devices, the iPod / made by the Apple computer company.
An iPod is small.
It can copy, save and play / music and written material.
You do not have to have an iPod / to listen to the broadcasts; / many people also listen to them / on a computer / with Internet connection.
The new broadcasters enjoy / sharing information / with their listeners.
Many say / podcasting is a new form / of the Internet Web log or blog.
It is another way / for a person to offer his or her ideas / to anyone who is interested.
People broadcast / about many subjects, / including religion, their everyday lives or hobbies / such as fishing or drinking wine.
Right now, / a very popular podcast is called / "The Dawn and Drew Show".
Dawn and Drew are a young wife and husband / who live in the state of Wisconsin.
Their show is meant to be funny.
In it, they talk about their lives / and whatever interests them / at that moment.
They bring guests / to their show, / including their parents and other family members.
Not much competition exists right now / among the different podcasts.
Many people speak / on more than one.
They are usually friendly.
One Web site has a list / of the ten most popular podcasts / based on votes by listeners.
It is called / podcast alley dot com.
It also lists / interesting new podcasts.
Thousands of podcasts are being created / all over the world.
If you are interested / in finding out about them, / go to podcastalley.com.
You can find a podcast / that interests you.
Or you might try / to create your own.
Today, we tell about a famous natural place, / the Grand Canyon.
In late September, 1540, / a group of Spanish explorers / led by Captain Garcia Lopez de Cardenas / came to a stop.
For weeks they had walked north / across the great southwestern American desert.
The land was dry.
The sun was hot.
They were searching for seven golden cities / that they had been told about.
There was not much to see / on this land, / just the far-away line / where the sky meets the ground.
Suddenly, they came to the edge / of what seemed to be a huge cut / in the Earth.
There seemed to be no way / to walk around this deep canyon.
It stretched below them / into the distance, / to their left and right, / as far as they could see.
Below them and across from where they stood / were strange shapes of yellow, red, brown and black rocks and stone.
A small, muddy river appeared to be flowing / at the bottom.
Captain Cardenas ordered three of his soldiers / to climb down the side of the canyon / to see if they could find a way / to cross to the other side.
The three climbed about one-third of the way down.
They found / that the canyon was much deeper / than they thought, / so they climbed back up.
Captain Cardenas and his group turned back / to the south.
Today, history recognizes them / as the first Europeans / to see the Grand Canyon, / formed by the Colorado River.
They had reached a place / that today is considered / one of the most beautiful, strange, and interesting places / in the world.
During the 19th century, / the population of the United States was expanding rapidly / to the west.
The Grand Canyon was considered a barrier / to travelers.
Only two places had been found / where the river is low enough to cross.
As settlers moved west, / the United States government wanted more information / about western territories.
Much of the Grand Canyon was unknown.
The words "Unknown Territory" were written / on maps that showed the area.
Today, the Grand Canyon is in a national park.
About five million people visit it each year.
They stop at its edge / and look in wonder / at a place / that can create great emotions / in those seeing it.
Others walk down the many paths / into the canyon.
Some ride rubber boats / down the Colorado River / through the Grand Canyon.
River guides are experts / at taking the boats / through the most violent rapids.
This activity, called white-water rafting, is very popular.
Generally, the trip takes about two weeks / in boats / that carry three or four people.
Bigger boats with motors / that carry about twenty people / can make the trip in several days.
As people float down the river, / they see the many wonderful and strange shapes / created by the forces of nature.
They may see animals, / such as bighorn sheep, and coyotes.
They experience the excitement / of traveling through white-water rapids, / and sleeping under the stars.
The sound of the river is always present, / sometimes loud, sometimes soft.
After several days traveling on and sleeping near the river / as it flows through the Grand Canyon, / many visitors say / they feel their cares and worries leave them.
Their concerns are replaced / by a feeling of wonder / about the canyon and the powers of nature.
Reality television programs are very popular / in the United States.
Many of these shows involve fierce competition / among people / who want to win a prize.
The competitors often will do anything / to win.
However, one reality show does good things / for people.
Sarah Long has this report / on "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition." / The popular television show is in its second season / on the ABC network.
It was developed / from another successful ABC reality show, / "Extreme Makeover." / That show provides / medical operations, weight loss programs / and other beauty help / to people / who want to look better.
"Extreme Makover: Home Edition" also helps people / by improving their homes.
The show finds a needy family / and sends them away / on a holiday.
While they are away, / the "Home Edition" team tears down and rebuilds / the family¬Åfs house.
These building projects would normally take months / to complete.
But the show requires / the work to be done / in just one week.
Ty Pennington leads / the show¬Åfs ten-member team.
They include experts / in planning, design and building.
Pennington is a carpenter.
He first gained fame / building furniture / on the popular home design television show, / "Trading Spaces." / "Home Edition" chooses families / who are needy / for different reasons.
On one program / the team made a house bigger / for a husband and wife / who were expecting three babies.
On another episode / the designers re-built a house / for eight children / whose parents had died.
On an upcoming show, / the team re-designs a house / for a man / who was blinded / by a gun shot.
The final show / of last season / provided a single mother / with a new home.
Brook Imbriani had a busy life / in California / working to support her children and her disabled mother.
She also saved the life / of a very sick baby / by providing her own bone marrow / for an operation.
The little girl is now four.
Her parents nominated Brooke Imbriani / for "Home Edition" / to say thank you.
The American television industry honored the show / last year.
"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" won the Emmy Award / for Outstanding Reality Program.
Now the show is one of the ten most popular shows / on American television.
Our question this week comes / from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Desta Terefe would like to know / about the Texas Rangers.
There is a team in baseball / with that name.
But our listener means / the famous group of law enforcement officers.
Over the years, / those Texas Rangers have been the subject / of books, movies and television programs.
In the city of Dallas, at Love Field Airport, / there is a large statue / of a man.
On his head / is a cowboy hat.
On his hip / is a large pistol.
His hand is not near the gun, / but it is easy to tell / that he could reach for it quickly.
Near the bottom of the statue / are the words / "One Riot, One Ranger!" / The Texas Rangers is one of the oldest law enforcement organizations / in North America.
The first group was organized / in 1823.
In the early history of the state, / the Texas Rangers acted / somewhere between a police force and a military force.
Their main task was to protect settlers / from Indian attacks.
Today, the main job of the Texas Rangers is to investigate and capture / wanted criminals.
They do this / by working / with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.
About 118 officers work / as Texas Rangers.
They are divided / into a headquarters group, / 6 companies of Rangers / and a special team / that investigates unsolved crimes.
Those / who want to become a Texas Ranger / must not only have police experience.
They must also have / at least eight years' experience / dealing with major crimes.
It is not unusual / for 200 police officers to apply / for one or two openings / in the Texas Rangers.
Farmers might think / the idea of growing food for fun sounds strange.
But there are some people / who do it all the time.
They grow some vegetables / because their natural color or shape is pleasing to see.
They grow others / because scientists have developed / new colors or different sizes / for traditional vegetables.
One example is the bell pepper.
Seed companies sell seeds / for several different kinds of bell peppers.
One pepper is a weak yellow color / when it begins to grow.
Then its color changes to white.
As it grows, / it changes color / two more times / -to orange, then red.
If you are not interested / in peppers that change colors / as they grow, / you can grow some / that remain one color.
You can try chocolate-colored peppers.
Or purple.
Or lavender ones.
Each kind of pepper has its own special taste.
For the best possible taste, however, / peppers should be left / on the vine / for two or three weeks / after they appear ready.
This gives them full flavor / and greatly increases / the vitamins they contain.
Another unusual plant is known / as the yard-long bean, asparagus bean, dow ghok or snake bean.
It grows / up to one meter in length.
It is an important part of the food supply / in areas of Asia.
American farmers like it / because it is different, yet tastes very much / like the green beans / they traditionally grow.
Each bean has from 10 to 20 seeds.
The outside or pod can be eaten.
Some of the very long beans are green outside / but have black-and-white or red seeds.
Gourds are plants / that people like to grow / because of the many different shapes.
They also have many uses.
Some round gourds are dried, painted / and made into containers.
Others have long necks and big bodies.
These are dried, cut and made into containers / to pour drinking water.
A kind of gourd / called the luffa / is used to make sponges.
When it is fully grown, / it is removed / from the vine / and permitted to dry / for a few weeks.
The gourd is placed in water / for a few hours.
The outer shell is then removed.
The gourd is placed in the sun / to dry.
When it is fully dry, / it is cut into pieces / for use as sponges.
Luffa sponges have a rough surface.
They can be used / to clean away dead skin cells, / which makes them a popular skin-care product. 
Our question this week is about the famous American comic strip / called "Peanuts." / Erfan Arabfakhri of Iran wants to know more / about its creator Charles Schulz / and "Peanuts" characters Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty.
Charles Schulz was born / in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1922.
He drew "Peanuts" / for almost 50 years.
It first appeared in American newspapers / in 1950.
The comic strip was about children and animals.
It still is.
Adults are never seen.
By 1999, / "Peanuts" appeared every day / in more than 2,600 newspapers / around the world.
People love the "Peanuts" characters / because they show the failings and strengths / of all human beings.
For example, / Charlie Brown makes many mistakes.
In fact, / he rarely gets anything right.
But he never stops trying.
Charlie Brown continues to trust people / even when they fail him repeatedly.
His relationship with his friend Lucy / is a good example.
Lucy promises Charlie Brown / that she will hold a football for him / so that he can kick it.
But as he quickly runs toward her / and extends his foot, / she pulls the ball away.
Charlie Brown flies up in the air / and lands flat on his back.
Lucy does this every time.
She never gives Charlie Brown a chance / to kick the ball.
Charlie Brown leads a baseball team / that always loses.
And he loves a little red-headed girl / who does not appear to feel the same way / about him.
But he remains hopeful.
Peppermint Patty is another member / of the "Peanuts Gang." / She loves sports and Charlie Brown.
She is the only one / who calls him "Chuck." / Peppermint Patty does not do well / in school.
She tries to find the easy way / to pass tests.
She is often caught sleeping / in class.
But this does not seem to affect / her strong belief in herself.
Charles Schulz was similar / to both characters.
Like Peppermint Patty / he had difficulty / with his school work.
Like Charlie Brown / he was not very good at sports.
And, as a young man / Schulz experienced the unreturned love  / of a red-headed woman.
Charles Schulz was married two times / and had five children.
He announced his retirement in 1999 / because of poor health.
His final daily comic strip appeared / in newspapers / on January 3, 2000.
He died a month later / at the age of 77.
The Peanuts Gang can still be seen / in newspapers around the world.
It is now called "Classic Peanuts." / No new strips have been created / since Charles Schulz stopped working.
Mr. Schulz did not want anyone else / to draw "Peanuts."
Mailing a letter in the United States requires a postage stamp / issued by the federal government.
Now, Americans can create their own postage stamps / on their computers.
Phoebe Zimmermann explains.
A company called Stamps.com has just started / a year of testing / to see if Americans want to create / their own Photo Stamps.
Last year, the company invited people / to send family pictures / that would be turned into legal postage stamps.
The service seemed popular.
The company received 83,000 pictures.
